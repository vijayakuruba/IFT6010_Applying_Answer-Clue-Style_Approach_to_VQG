0	0	Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season.
0	1	The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to earn their third Super Bowl title.
0	2	The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California.
0	3	As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.
1	4	The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP).
1	5	They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise was founded in 1995.
1	6	The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record, and denied the New England Patriots a chance to defend their title from Super Bowl XLIX by defeating them 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game.
1	7	They joined the Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl.
2	8	The Broncos took an early lead in Super Bowl 50 and never trailed.
2	9	Newton was limited by Denver's defense, which sacked him seven times and forced him into three turnovers, including a fumble which they recovered for a touchdown.
2	10	Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP, recording five solo tackles, 2½ sacks, and two forced fumbles.
3	11	CBS broadcast Super Bowl 50 in the U.S., and charged an average of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game.
3	12	The Super Bowl 50 halftime show was headlined by the British rock group Coldplay with special guest performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII and Super Bowl XLVIII halftime shows, respectively.
3	13	It was the third-most watched U.S. broadcast ever.
4	14	In early 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the league planned to make the 50th Super Bowl "spectacular" and that it would be "an important game for us as a league".
5	15	The league eventually narrowed the bids to three sites: New Orleans' Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Miami's Sun Life Stadium, and the San Francisco Bay Area's Levi's Stadium.
6	16	The league announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life Stadium and Levi's Stadium.
6	17	The South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted the event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one being Super Bowl XLIV in 2010.
6	18	The San Francisco Bay Area last hosted in 1985 (Super Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the home team 49ers.
6	19	The Miami bid depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations.
6	20	However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami's chances.
7	21	On May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston voted and awarded the game to Levi's Stadium.
7	22	The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014.
7	23	It is the first Super Bowl held in the San Francisco Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX in 1985, and the first in California since Super Bowl XXXVII took place in San Diego in 2003.
8	24	For the third straight season, the number one seeds from both conferences met in the Super Bowl.
8	25	The Carolina Panthers became one of only ten teams to have completed a regular season with only one loss, and one of only six teams to have acquired a 15–1 record, while the Denver Broncos became one of four teams to have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl.
8	26	The Broncos made their second Super Bowl appearance in three years, having reached Super Bowl XLVIII, while the Panthers made their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, their other appearance being Super Bowl XXXVIII.
8	27	Coincidentally, both teams were coached by John Fox in their last Super Bowl appearance prior to Super Bowl 50.
9	28	Despite waiving longtime running back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers had their best regular season in franchise history, becoming the seventh team to win at least 15 regular season games since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978.
9	29	Carolina started the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records for the best start and the longest single-season winning streak, but also posting the best start to a season by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0 record previously shared with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green Bay Packers.
9	30	With their NFC-best 15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise history.
9	31	Ten players were selected to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history) along with eight All-Pro selections.
10	32	The Panthers offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections.
10	33	Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636, while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing, 10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4.
10	34	Newton's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen, who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr., who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards.
10	35	Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie Devin Funchess (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year receiver Corey Brown (31 receptions for 447 yards).
10	36	The Panthers backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart, who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert, who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards.
10	37	Carolina's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner.
11	38	The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points, ranking sixth in the league, while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections.
11	39	Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two.
11	40	Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks.
11	41	The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen, a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL's active career sack leader with 136, along with defensive end Kony Ealy, who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts.
11	42	Behind them, two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly.
11	43	Davis compiled 5½ sacks, four forced fumbles, and four interceptions, while Kuechly led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles, and intercepted four passes of his own.
11	44	Carolina's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman, who led the team with a career high seven interceptions, while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns.
12	45	Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season's playoffs, the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox (who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach), and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach.
12	46	Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season.
12	47	Although the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions.
12	48	In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot.
12	49	He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season.
12	50	Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.
12	51	Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records.
12	52	With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.
13	53	Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions.
13	54	In contrast, Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4.
13	55	Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning punts.
13	56	Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards.
13	57	Running back C. J. Anderson was the team's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards.
13	58	Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards, five touchdowns, 24 receptions, and a 4.7 yards per carry average.
13	59	Overall, the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.
14	60	The Broncos' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the first time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296).
14	61	Defensive ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks.
14	62	Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three.
14	63	Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his career, ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks.
14	64	Linebacker Brandon Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109, while Danny Trevathan ranked second with 102.
14	65	Cornerbacks Aqib Talib (three interceptions) and Chris Harris, Jr. (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense.
15	66	The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round, running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31–24, avenging their elimination from a year earlier.
15	67	The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game, 49–15, racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.
16	68	The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round, 23–16, by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game.
16	69	They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, 20–18, by intercepting a pass on New England's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock.
16	70	Despite Manning's problems with interceptions during the season, he didn't throw any in their two playoff games.
17	71	Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game.
17	72	Despite this, he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl.
17	73	His prediction turned out to be accurate.
18	74	Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls.
18	75	He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39.
18	76	The past record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager.
19	77	This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes.
19	78	Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft, while Newton was picked first in 2011.
19	79	The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver.
19	80	Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was 26).
20	81	With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV, this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves.
21	82	Concerns were raised over whether Levi's Stadium's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl; during the inaugural season, the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field goal, although the field has not had any major issues since.
21	83	As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf.
21	84	NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in "great shape" for gameday.
21	85	However, the turf showed problem throughout the game, with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game.
22	86	As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants.
22	87	Elway stated, "We've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms."
22	88	The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway's last game as Denver QB, when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19.
22	89	In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys, which was their primary color at the time.
22	90	They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys, but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys, losing in Super Bowl XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII.
22	91	The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior.
22	92	The Broncos' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform: black jerseys with silver pants.
23	93	The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott.
23	94	The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott.
24	95	On June 4, 2014, the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals, a practice established at Super Bowl V, would be temporarily suspended, and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI.
24	96	Jaime Weston, the league's vice president of brand and creative, explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter "L" using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV.
24	97	The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals, colored in gold, behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.
25	98	Various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season to tie into the "Golden Super Bowl"; gold-tinted logos were implemented across the NFL's properties and painted on fields, the numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold, and beginning on week 7, all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos.
25	99	Gold footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl, and "homecoming" events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games.
26	100	The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.
26	101	In addition, "Super Bowl City" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero, featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area's technology, culinary creations, and cultural diversity.
26	102	More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week.
26	103	San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area "they are going to have to leave".
26	104	San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $5 million.
27	105	In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally.
27	106	A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors, but still may need the city council to help fund the event.
27	107	Additional funding will be provided by the city council, which has announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event.
28	108	The game's media day, which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game, was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night.
28	109	The event was held on February 1, 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose.
28	110	Alongside the traditional media availabilities, the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge.
29	111	For the first time, the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect, the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl.
29	112	The host committee has already raised over $40 million through sponsors including Apple, Google, Yahoo!, Intel, Gap, Chevron, and Dignity Health.
30	113	The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be "the most giving Super Bowl ever", and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes in the Bay Area.
30	114	The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development, community investment and sustainable environments.
31	115	In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive, the winner of Super Bowl 50 will also receive a large, 18-karat gold-plated "50".
31	116	Each digit will weigh 33 lb (15 kg) for a total of 66 lb (30 kg).
31	117	Like the Lombardi Trophy, the "50" will be designed by Tiffany & Co.
32	118	In the United States, the game was televised by CBS, as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL.
32	119	The network's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest, with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines.
32	120	CBS introduced new features during the telecast, including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and "bullet time" effects.
32	121	(An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV; for Super Bowl 50, the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution.)
33	122	On December 28, 2015, ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game, marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl.
33	123	Unlike NBC and Fox, CBS does not have a Spanish-language outlet of its own that could broadcast the game (though per league policy, a separate Spanish play-by-play call was carried on CBS's second audio program channel for over-the-air viewers).
33	124	The game was called by ESPN Deportes' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre, and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe.
33	125	ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage, while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe contributed English-language reports for ESPN's SportsCenter and Mike & Mike.
34	126	CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com, and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10, Xbox One and other digital media players (such as Chromecast and Roku).
34	127	Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity, streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service.
34	128	The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN.
35	129	As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes of its late night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning with a special episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game.
35	130	Following a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden.
36	131	CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $5,000,000, a record high price for a Super Bowl ad.
36	132	As of January 26, the advertisements had not yet sold out.
36	133	CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that for the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast.
36	134	This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount.
36	135	It was also the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its "Crash the Super Bowl" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game.
36	136	Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut, promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise.
37	137	QuickBooks sponsored a "Small Business Big Game" contest, in which Death Wish Coffee had a 30-second commercial aired free of charge courtesy of QuickBooks.
37	138	Death Wish Coffee beat out nine other contenders from across the United States for the free advertisement.
38	139	20th Century Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl.
38	140	Fox paid for Deadpool, X-Men: Apocalypse, Independence Day: Resurgence and Eddie the Eagle, Lionsgate paid for Gods of Egypt, Paramount paid for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows and 10 Cloverfield Lane, Universal paid for The Secret Life of Pets and the debut trailer for Jason Bourne and Disney paid for Captain America: Civil War, The Jungle Book and Alice Through the Looking Glass.
39	141	Westwood One will carry the game throughout North America, with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer, Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts, and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters.
39	142	Jim Gray will anchor the pre-game and halftime coverage.
40	143	The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team will carry their local play-by-play calls.
40	144	In Denver, KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5 FM) will carry the game, with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary.
40	145	In North Carolina, WBT (1110 AM) will carry the game, with Mick Mixon on play-by-play and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary.
40	146	WBT will also simulcast the game on its sister station WBT-FM (99.3 FM), which is based in Chester, South Carolina.
40	147	As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations, the local broadcasts will be audible over much of the western United States after sunset (for Denver) and the eastern United States throughout the game (for Carolina).
40	148	In accordance with contractual rules, the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks will either carry the Westwood One feed or not carry the game at all.
41	149	In the United Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra will carry the contest.
41	150	The BBC will carry its own British English broadcast, with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary.
42	151	In honor of the 50th Super Bowl, the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players.
42	152	Bart Starr (MVP of Super Bowls I and II) and Chuck Howley (MVP of Super Bowl V) appeared via video, while Peyton Manning (MVP of Super Bowl XLI and current Broncos quarterback) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game.
42	153	No plans were announced regarding the recognition of Harvey Martin, co-MVP of Super Bowl XII, who died in 2001.
43	154	Six-time Grammy winner and Academy Award nominee Lady Gaga performed the national anthem, while Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin provided American Sign Language (ASL) translation.
44	155	In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that "multiple acts" would perform during the halftime show.
44	156	On December 3, the league confirmed that the show would be headlined by the British rock group Coldplay.
44	157	On January 7, 2016, Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single "Hymn for the Weekend", would be making an appearance.
44	158	Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, and Mark Ronson also performed.
45	159	Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell.
45	160	A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina's defense dug in over the next three plays.
45	161	First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss.
45	162	Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal.
45	163	The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit.
46	164	After each team punted, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery, but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge.
46	165	CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete.
46	166	A few plays later, on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line, linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton's hands while sacking him, and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown, giving the team a 10–0 lead.
46	167	This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season.
47	168	After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play, 73-yard scoring drive.
47	169	Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter.
47	170	Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted to make a tackle, apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch.
47	171	Norwood had not done so, and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line.
47	172	Despite Denver's excellent field position, they could not get the ball into the end zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7.
48	173	On Carolina's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line.
48	174	However, the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock.
48	175	The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt.
48	176	After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line.
48	177	But with 11 seconds left, Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half.
49	178	The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play.

75	336	Folk etymology attributes the city name to a fisherman, Wars, and his wife, Sawa.
75	337	According to legend, Sawa was a mermaid living in the Vistula River with whom Wars fell in love.
75	338	In actuality, Warsz was a 12th/13th-century nobleman who owned a village located at the modern-day site of Mariensztat neighbourhood.
75	339	See also the Vršovci family which had escaped to Poland.

75	341	A native or resident of Warsaw is known as a Varsovian – in Polish warszawiak (male), warszawianka (female), warszawiacy (plural).
76	342	The first fortified settlements on the site of today's Warsaw were located in Bródno (9th/10th century) and Jazdów (12th/13th century).
76	343	After Jazdów was raided by nearby clans and dukes, a new similar settlement was established on the site of a small fishing village called Warszowa.
76	344	The Prince of Płock, Bolesław II of Masovia, established this settlement, the modern-day Warsaw, in about 1300.
76	345	In the beginning of the 14th century it became one of the seats of the Dukes of Masovia, becoming the official capital of Masovian Duchy in 1413.
76	346	14th-century Warsaw's economy rested on mostly crafts and trade.
76	347	Upon the extinction of the local ducal line, the duchy was reincorporated into the Polish Crown in 1526.
77	348	In 1529, Warsaw for the first time became the seat of the General Sejm, permanent from 1569.
77	349	In 1573 the city gave its name to the Warsaw Confederation, formally establishing religious freedom in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
77	350	Due to its central location between the Commonwealth's capitals of Kraków and Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Kraków to Warsaw in 1596.
77	351	In the following years the town expanded towards the suburbs.
77	352	Several private independent districts were established, the property of aristocrats and the gentry, which were ruled by their own laws.
77	353	Three times between 1655–1658 the city was under siege and three times it was taken and pillaged by the Swedish, Brandenburgian and Transylvanian forces.

78	357	The Royal University of Warsaw was established in 1816.
79	358	Warsaw was occupied by Germany from 4 August 1915 until November 1918.
79	359	The Allied Armistice terms required in Article 12 that Germany withdraw from areas controlled by Russia in 1914, which included Warsaw.
79	360	Germany did so, and underground leader Piłsudski returned to Warsaw on 11 November and set up what became the Second Polish Republic, with Warsaw the capital.
79	361	In the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1920, the huge Battle of Warsaw was fought on the eastern outskirts of the city in which the capital was successfully defended and the Red Army defeated.
79	362	Poland stopped by itself the full brunt of the Red Army and defeated an idea of the "export of the revolution".
80	363	After the German Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 began the Second World War, Warsaw was defended till September 27.
80	364	Central Poland, including Warsaw, came under the rule of the General Government, a German Nazi colonial administration.
80	365	All higher education institutions were immediately closed and Warsaw's entire Jewish population – several hundred thousand, some 30% of the city – herded into the Warsaw Ghetto.
80	366	The city would become the centre of urban resistance to Nazi rule in occupied Europe.
80	367	When the order came to annihilate the ghetto as part of Hitler's "Final Solution" on 19 April 1943, Jewish fighters launched the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.
80	368	Despite being heavily outgunned and outnumbered, the Ghetto held out for almost a month.
80	369	When the fighting ended, almost all survivors were massacred, with only a few managing to escape or hide.
81	370	By July 1944, the Red Army was deep into Polish territory and pursuing the Germans toward Warsaw.
81	371	Knowing that Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland, the Polish government-in-exile in London gave orders to the underground Home Army (AK) to try to seize control of Warsaw from the Germans before the Red Army arrived.
81	372	Thus, on 1 August 1944, as the Red Army was nearing the city, the Warsaw Uprising began.
81	373	The armed struggle, planned to last 48 hours, was partially successful, however it went on for 63 days.
81	374	Eventually the Home Army fighters and civilians assisting them were forced to capitulate.
81	375	They were transported to PoW camps in Germany, while the entire civilian population was expelled.
81	376	Polish civilian deaths are estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000.
82	377	After World War II, under a Communist regime set up by the conquering Soviets, the "Bricks for Warsaw" campaign was initiated, and large prefabricated housing projects were erected in Warsaw to address the housing shortage, along with other typical buildings of an Eastern Bloc city, such as the Palace of Culture and Science, a gift from the Soviet Union.
82	378	The city resumed its role as the capital of Poland and the country's centre of political and economic life.
82	379	Many of the historic streets, buildings, and churches were restored to their original form.
82	380	In 1980, Warsaw's historic Old Town was inscribed onto UNESCO's World Heritage list.
83	381	John Paul II's visits to his native country in 1979 and 1983 brought support to the budding solidarity movement and encouraged the growing anti-communist fervor there.
83	382	In 1979, less than a year after becoming pope, John Paul celebrated Mass in Victory Square in Warsaw and ended his sermon with a call to "renew the face" of Poland: Let Thy Spirit descend!
83	383	Let Thy Spirit descend and renew the face of the land!
83	384	These words were very meaningful for the Polish citizens who understood them as the incentive for the democratic changes.
84	385	Warsaw lies in east-central Poland about 300 km (190 mi) from the Carpathian Mountains and about 260 km (160 mi) from the Baltic Sea, 523 km (325 mi) east of Berlin, Germany.
84	386	The city straddles the Vistula River.
84	387	It is located in the heartland of the Masovian Plain, and its average elevation is 100 metres (330 ft) above sea level.
84	388	The highest point on the left side of the city lies at a height of 115.7 metres (379.6 ft) ("Redutowa" bus depot, district of Wola), on the right side – 122.1 metres (400.6 ft) ("Groszówka" estate, district of Wesoła, by the eastern border).
84	389	The lowest point lies at a height 75.6 metres (248.0 ft) (at the right bank of the Vistula, by the eastern border of Warsaw).
84	390	There are some hills (mostly artificial) located within the confines of the city – e.g.
84	391	Warsaw Uprising Hill (121 metres (397.0 ft)), Szczęśliwice hill (138 metres (452.8 ft) – the highest point of Warsaw in general).
85	392	Warsaw is located on two main geomorphologic formations: the plain moraine plateau and the Vistula Valley with its asymmetrical pattern of different terraces.
85	393	The Vistula River is the specific axis of Warsaw, which divides the city into two parts, left and right.
85	394	The left one is situated both on the moraine plateau (10 to 25 m (32.8 to 82.0 ft) above Vistula level) and on the Vistula terraces (max.
85	395	6.5 m (21.3 ft) above Vistula level).
85	396	The significant element of the relief, in this part of Warsaw, is the edge of moraine plateau called Warsaw Escarpment.
85	397	It is 20 to 25 m (65.6 to 82.0 ft) high in the Old Town and Central district and about 10 m (32.8 ft) in the north and south of Warsaw.
85	398	It goes through the city and plays an important role as a landmark.
86	399	The plain moraine plateau has only a few natural and artificial ponds and also groups of clay pits.
86	400	The pattern of the Vistula terraces is asymmetrical.
86	401	The left side consist mainly of two levels: the highest one contains former flooded terraces and the lowest one the flood plain terrace.
86	402	The contemporary flooded terrace still has visible valleys and ground depressions with water systems coming from the Vistula old – riverbed.
86	403	They consist of still quite natural streams and lakes as well as the pattern of drainage ditches.
86	404	The right side of Warsaw has a different pattern of geomorphological forms.
86	405	There are several levels of the plain Vistula terraces (flooded as well as former flooded once) and only small part and not so visible moraine escarpment.
86	406	Aeolian sand with a number of dunes parted by peat swamps or small ponds cover the highest terrace.
86	407	These are mainly forested areas (pine forest).
87	408	Warsaw's mixture of architectural styles reflects the turbulent history of the city and country.
87	409	During the Second World War, Warsaw was razed to the ground by bombing raids and planned destruction.
87	410	After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled PRL.
87	411	Most of the historical buildings were thoroughly reconstructed.
87	412	However, some of the buildings from the 19th century that had been preserved in reasonably reconstructible form were nonetheless eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g.
87	413	Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of Eastern bloc countries.
88	414	Gothic architecture is represented in the majestic churches but also at the burgher houses and fortifications.
88	415	The most significant buildings are St. John's Cathedral (14th century), the temple is a typical example of the so-called Masovian gothic style, St. Mary's Church (1411), a town house of Burbach family (14th century), Gunpowder Tower (after 1379) and the Royal Castle Curia Maior (1407–1410).
88	416	The most notable examples of Renaissance architecture in the city are the house of Baryczko merchant family (1562), building called "The Negro" (early 17th century) and Salwator tenement (1632).
88	417	The most interesting examples of mannerist architecture are the Royal Castle (1596–1619) and the Jesuit Church (1609–1626) at Old Town.
88	418	Among the first structures of the early baroque the most important are St. Hyacinth's Church (1603–1639) and Sigismund's Column (1644).
89	419	Building activity occurred in numerous noble palaces and churches during the later decades of the 17th century.
89	420	One of the best examples of this architecture are Krasiński Palace (1677–1683), Wilanów Palace (1677–1696) and St. Kazimierz Church (1688–1692).
89	421	The most impressive examples of rococo architecture are Czapski Palace (1712–1721), Palace of the Four Winds (1730s) and Visitationist Church (façade 1728–1761).
89	422	The neoclassical architecture in Warsaw can be described by the simplicity of the geometrical forms teamed with a great inspiration from the Roman period.
89	423	Some of the best examples of the neoclassical style are the Palace on the Water (rebuilt 1775–1795), Królikarnia (1782–1786), Carmelite Church (façade 1761–1783) and Evangelical Holy Trinity Church (1777–1782).
89	424	The economic growth during the first years of Congress Poland caused a rapid rise architecture.
89	425	The Neoclassical revival affected all aspects of architecture, the most notable are the Great Theater (1825–1833) and buildings located at Bank Square (1825–1828).
90	426	Exceptional examples of the bourgeois architecture of the later periods were not restored by the communist authorities after the war (like mentioned Kronenberg Palace and Insurance Company Rosja building) or they were rebuilt in socialist realism style (like Warsaw Philharmony edifice originally inspired by Palais Garnier in Paris).
90	427	Despite that the Warsaw University of Technology building (1899–1902) is the most interesting of the late 19th-century architecture.
90	428	Some 19th-century buildings in the Praga district (the Vistula’s right bank) have been restored although many have been poorly maintained.
90	429	Warsaw’s municipal government authorities have decided to rebuild the Saxon Palace and the Brühl Palace, the most distinctive buildings in prewar Warsaw.
91	430	There are also many places commemorating the heroic history of Warsaw.
91	431	Pawiak, an infamous German Gestapo prison now occupied by a Mausoleum of Memory of Martyrdom and the museum, is only the beginning of a walk in the traces of Heroic City.
91	432	The Warsaw Citadel, an impressive 19th-century fortification built after the defeat of the November Uprising, was a place of martyr for the Poles.
91	433	Another important monument, the statue of Little Insurgent located at the ramparts of the Old Town, commemorates the children who served as messengers and frontline troops in the Warsaw Uprising, while the impressive Warsaw Uprising Monument by Wincenty Kućma was erected in memory of the largest insurrection of World War II.
92	434	Other green spaces in the city include the Botanic Garden and the University Library garden.
92	435	They have extensive botanical collection of rare domestic and foreign plants, while a palm house in the New Orangery displays plants of subtropics from all over the world.
92	436	Besides, within the city borders, there are also: Pole Mokotowskie (a big park in the northern Mokotów, where was the first horse racetrack and then the airport), Park Ujazdowski (close to the Sejm and John Lennon street), Park of Culture and Rest in Powsin, by the southern city border, Park Skaryszewski by the right Vistula bank, in Praga.
92	437	The oldest park in Praga, the Praga Park, was established in 1865–1871 and designed by Jan Dobrowolski.
92	438	In 1927 a zoological garden (Ogród Zoologiczny) was established on the park grounds, and in 1952 a bear run, still open today.
93	439	The flora of the city may be considered very rich in species.
93	440	The species richness is mainly due to the location of Warsaw within the border region of several big floral regions comprising substantial proportions of close-to-wilderness areas (natural forests, wetlands along the Vistula) as well as arable land, meadows and forests.
93	441	Bielany Forest, located within the borders of Warsaw, is the remaining part of the Masovian Primeval Forest.
93	442	Bielany Forest nature reserve is connected with Kampinos Forest.
93	443	It is home to rich fauna and flora.
93	444	Within the forest there are three cycling and walking trails.
93	445	Other big forest area is Kabaty Forest by the southern city border.
93	446	Warsaw has also two botanic gardens: by the Łazienki park (a didactic-research unit of the University of Warsaw) as well as by the Park of Culture and Rest in Powsin (a unit of the Polish Academy of Science).
94	447	In 1939, c. 1,300,000 people lived in Warsaw, but in 1945 – only 420,000.
94	448	During the first years after the war, the population growth was c. 6%, so shortly the city started to suffer from the lack of flats and of areas for new houses.
94	449	The first remedial measure was the Warsaw area enlargement (1951) – but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations: only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (like renowned specialists) were allowed to get the registration, hence halving the population growth in the following years.
94	450	It also bolstered some kind of conviction among Poles that Varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital.
94	451	Unfortunately this belief still lives on in Poland (although not as much as it used to be) – even though since 1990 there are no limitations to residency registration anymore.
95	452	Throughout its existence, Warsaw has been a multi-cultural city.
95	453	According to the 1901 census, out of 711,988 inhabitants 56.2% were Catholics, 35.7% Jews, 5% Greek orthodox Christians and 2.8% Protestants.
95	454	Eight years later, in 1909, there were 281,754 Jews (36.9%), 18,189 Protestants (2.4%) and 2,818 Mariavites (0.4%).
95	455	This led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town.
95	456	Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.
95	457	After the war, the new communist authorities of Poland discouraged church construction and only a small number were rebuilt.
96	458	The basic unit of territorial division in Poland is a commune (gmina).
96	459	A city is also a commune – but with the city charter.
96	460	Both cities and communes are governed by a mayor – but in the communes the mayor is vogt (wójt in Polish), however in the cities – burmistrz.
96	461	Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, i.e.
96	462	tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division – counties or powiats.
96	463	An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a gmina cannot register cars, this is a powiat's task (i.e.
96	464	a registration number depends on what powiat a car had been registered, not gmina).
96	465	In this case we say about city county or powiat grodzki.
96	466	Such cities are for example Lublin, Kraków, Gdańsk, Poznań.
96	467	In Warsaw, its districts additionally have some of powiat's entitlements – like already mentioned car registration.
96	468	For example, the district Wola has its own evidence and the district Ursynów – its own (and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than these from Ursynów).
96	469	But for instance the districts in Kraków do not have entitlements of powiat, so the registration numbers in Kraków are of the same type for all districts.
97	470	Legislative power in Warsaw is vested in a unicameral Warsaw City Council (Rada Miasta), which comprises 60 members.
97	471	Council members are elected directly every four years.
97	472	Like most legislative bodies, the City Council divides itself into committees which have the oversight of various functions of the city government.
97	473	Bills passed by a simple majority are sent to the mayor (the President of Warsaw), who may sign them into law.
97	474	If the mayor vetoes a bill, the Council has 30 days to override the veto by a two-thirds majority vote.
98	475	The mayor of Warsaw is called President.
98	476	Generally, in Poland, the mayors of bigger cities are called presidents – i.e.
98	477	such cities, which have over 100,000 people or these, where already was president before 1990.
98	478	The first Warsaw President was Jan Andrzej Menich (1695–1696).
98	479	Between 1975 and 1990 the Warsaw Presidents was simultaneously the Warsaw Voivode.
98	480	Since 1990 the President of Warsaw had been elected by the City council.
98	481	In the years of 1994–1999 the mayor of the district Centrum automatically was designated as the President of Warsaw: the mayor of Centrum was elected by the district council of Centrum and the council was elected only by the Centrum residents.
98	482	Since 2002 the President of Warsaw is elected by all of the citizens of Warsaw.
99	483	Warsaw, especially its city centre (Śródmieście), is home not only to many national institutions and government agencies, but also to many domestic and international companies.
99	484	In 2006, 304,016 companies were registered in the city.
99	485	Warsaw's ever-growing business community has been noticed globally, regionally, and nationally.
99	486	MasterCard Emerging Market Index has noted Warsaw's economic strength and commercial center.
99	487	Moreover, Warsaw was ranked as the 7th greatest emerging market.
99	488	Foreign investors' financial participation in the city's development was estimated in 2002 at over 650 million euro.
99	489	Warsaw produces 12% of Poland's national income, which in 2008 was 305.1% of the Polish average, per capita (or 160% of the European Union average).
99	490	The GDP per capita in Warsaw amounted to PLN 94 000 in 2008 (c. EUR 23 800, USD 33 000).
99	491	Total nominal GDP of the city in 2010 amounted to 191.766 billion PLN, 111696 PLN per capita, which was 301,1 % of Polish average.
99	492	Warsaw leads the region of East-Central Europe in foreign investment and in 2006, GDP growth met expectations with a level of 6.1%.
99	493	It also has one of the fastest growing economies, with GDP growth at 6.5 percent in 2007 and 6.1 percent in the first quarter of 2008.
100	494	Warsaw's first stock exchange was established in 1817 and continued trading until World War II.
100	495	It was re-established in April 1991, following the end of the post-war communist control of the country and the reintroduction of a free-market economy.
100	496	Today, the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) is, according to many indicators, the largest market in the region, with 374 companies listed and total capitalization of 162 584 mln EUR as of 31 August 2009.
100	497	From 1991 until 2000, the stock exchange was, ironically, located in the building previously used as the headquarters of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR).
101	498	The FSO Car Factory was established in 1951.
101	499	A number of vehicles have been assembled there over the decades, including the Warszawa, Syrena, Fiat 125p (under license from Fiat, later renamed FSO 125p when the license expired) and the Polonez.
101	500	The last two models listed were also sent abroad and assembled in a number of other countries, including Egypt and Colombia.
101	501	In 1995 the factory was purchased by the South Korean car manufacturer Daewoo, which assembled the Tico, Espero, Nubia, Tacuma, Leganza, Lanos and Matiz there for the European market.
101	502	In 2005 the factory was sold to AvtoZAZ, a Ukrainian car manufacturer which assembled there the Chevrolet Aveo.
101	503	The license for the production of the Aveo expired in February 2011 and has since not been renewed.
102	504	Warsaw (Polish: Warszawa [varˈʂava] ( listen); see also other names) is the capital and largest city of Poland.
102	505	It stands on the Vistula River in east-central Poland, roughly 260 kilometres (160 mi) from the Baltic Sea and 300 kilometres (190 mi) from the Carpathian Mountains.
102	506	Its population is estimated at 1.740 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 2.666 million residents, which makes Warsaw the 9th most-populous capital city in the European Union.
102	507	The city limits cover 516.9 square kilometres (199.6 sq mi), while the metropolitan area covers 6,100.43 square kilometres (2,355.39 sq mi).
103	508	The Normans (Norman: Nourmands; French: Normands; Latin: Normanni) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy, a region in France.
103	509	They were descended from Norse ("Norman" comes from "Norseman") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia.
103	510	Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations, their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia.
103	511	The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries.
104	512	The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East.
104	513	The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated.
104	514	They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language.
104	515	The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure.
104	516	The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations.
104	517	Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.
104	518	Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.
105	519	The English name "Normans" comes from the French words Normans/Normanz, plural of Normant, modern French normand, which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann "Northman" or directly from Old Norse Norðmaðr, Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century) to mean "Norseman, Viking".
106	520	In the course of the 10th century, the initially destructive incursions of Norse war bands into the rivers of France evolved into more permanent encampments that included local women and personal property.
106	521	The Duchy of Normandy, which began in 911 as a fiefdom, was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo, and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria.
106	522	The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions.
106	523	The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine.
106	524	The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen, and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II (part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis).
107	525	Before Rollo's arrival, its populations did not differ from Picardy or the Île-de-France, which were considered "Frankish".
107	526	Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s, but were divided between colonies in the east (Roumois and Pays de Caux) around the low Seine valley and in the west in the Cotentin Peninsula, and were separated by traditional pagii, where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers.
107	527	Rollo's contingents who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the Atlantic coast included Danes, Norwegians, Norse–Gaels, Orkney Vikings, possibly Swedes, and Anglo-Danes from the English Danelaw under Norse control.
108	528	The descendants of Rollo's Vikings and their Frankish wives would replace the Norse religion and Old Norse language with Catholicism (Christianity) and the Gallo-Romance language of the local people, blending their maternal Frankish heritage with Old Norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique "Norman" culture in the north of France.
108	529	The Norman language was forged by the adoption of the indigenous langue d'oïl branch of Romance by a Norse-speaking ruling class, and it developed into the regional language that survives today.
109	530	The Normans thereafter adopted the growing feudal doctrines of the rest of France, and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both Normandy and in England.
109	531	The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old French aristocracy, most of whom traced their lineage to Franks of the Carolingian dynasty.
109	532	Most Norman knights remained poor and land-hungry, and by 1066 Normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation.
109	533	Many Normans of Italy, France and England eventually served as avid Crusaders under the Italo-Norman prince Bohemund I and the Anglo-Norman king Richard the Lion-Heart.
110	534	Opportunistic bands of Normans successfully established a foothold in Southern Italy (the Mezzogiorno).
110	535	Probably as the result of returning pilgrims' stories, the Normans entered the Mezzogiorno as warriors in 1017 at the latest.
110	536	In 999, according to Amatus of Montecassino, Norman pilgrims returning from Jerusalem called in at the port of Salerno when a Saracen attack occurred.
110	537	The Normans fought so valiantly that Prince Guaimar III begged them to stay, but they refused and instead offered to tell others back home of the prince's request.
110	538	William of Apulia tells that, in 1016, Norman pilgrims to the shrine of the Archangel Michael at Monte Gargano were met by Melus of Bari, a Lombard nobleman and rebel, who persuaded them to return with more warriors to help throw off the Byzantine rule, which they did.
111	539	The two most prominent Norman families to arrive in the Mediterranean were descendants of Tancred of Hauteville and the Drengot family, of whom Rainulf Drengot received the county of Aversa, the first Norman toehold in the south, from Duke Sergius IV of Naples in 1030.
111	540	The Hauteville family achieved princely rank by proclaiming prince Guaimar IV of Salerno "Duke of Apulia and Calabria".
111	541	He promptly awarded their elected leader, William Iron Arm, with the title of count in his capital of Melfi.
111	542	The Drengot family thereafter attained the principality of Capua, and emperor Henry III legally ennobled the Hauteville leader, Drogo, as "dux et magister Italiae comesque Normannorum totius Apuliae et Calabriae" ("Duke and Master of Italy and Count of the Normans of all Apulia and Calabria") in 1047.
112	543	From these bases, the Normans eventually captured Sicily and Malta from the Saracens, under the leadership of the famous Robert Guiscard, a Hauteville, and his younger brother Roger the Great Count.
112	544	Roger's son, Roger II of Sicily, was crowned king in 1130 (exactly one century after Rainulf was "crowned" count) by Antipope Anacletus II.
112	545	The Kingdom of Sicily lasted until 1194, when it was transferred to the House of Hohenstaufen through marriage.
112	546	The Normans left their legacy in many castles, such as William Iron Arm's citadel at Squillace, and cathedrals, such as Roger II's Cappella Palatina chapel at Palermo, which dot the landscape and give a wholly distinct architectural flavor to accompany its unique history.
113	547	Institutionally, the Normans combined the administrative machinery of the Byzantines, Arabs, and Lombards with their own conceptions of feudal law and order to forge a unique government.
113	548	Under this state, there was great religious freedom, and alongside the Norman nobles existed a meritocratic bureaucracy of Jews, Muslims and Christians, both Catholic and Eastern Orthodox.
113	549	The Kingdom of Sicily thus became characterized by Norman, Byzantine Greek, Arab, Lombard and "native" Sicilian populations living in harmony, and its Norman rulers fostered plans of establishing an Empire that would have encompassed Fatimid Egypt as well as the Crusader states in the Levant.
113	550	One of the great geographical treatises of the Middle Ages, the "Tabula Rogeriana", was written by the Andalusian al-Idrisi for king Roger II of Sicily, and entitled "Kitab Rudjdjar" ("The Book of Roger").
114	551	Soon after the Normans began to enter Italy, they entered the Byzantine Empire and then Armenia, fighting against the Pechenegs, the Bulgars, and especially the Seljuk Turks.
114	552	Norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the Lombards to act against the Byzantines, but they soon fought in Byzantine service in Sicily.
114	553	They were prominent alongside Varangian and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of George Maniaces in 1038–40.
114	554	There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy, and it now seems likely only a few came from there.
114	555	It is also unknown how many of the "Franks", as the Byzantines called them, were Normans and not other Frenchmen.
115	556	One of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was Hervé in the 1050s.
115	557	By then however, there were already Norman mercenaries serving as far away as Trebizond and Georgia.
115	558	They were based at Malatya and Edessa, under the Byzantine duke of Antioch, Isaac Komnenos.
115	559	In the 1060s, Robert Crispin led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks.
115	560	Roussel de Bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state in Asia Minor with support from the local population, but he was stopped by the Byzantine general Alexius Komnenos.
116	561	Some Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenians vassal-states of Sassoun and Taron in far eastern Anatolia.
116	562	Later, many took up service with the Armenian state further south in Cilicia and the Taurus Mountains.
116	563	A Norman named Oursel led a force of "Franks" into the upper Euphrates valley in northern Syria.
116	564	From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general Philaretus Brachamius were Normans—formerly of Oursel—led by Raimbaud.
116	565	They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning "Franks."
116	566	The known trade between Amalfi and Antioch and between Bari and Tarsus may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy.
117	567	Several families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration, when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors.
117	568	The Raoulii were descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul, the Petraliphae were descended from a Pierre d'Aulps, and that group of Albanian clans known as the Maniakates were descended from Normans who served under George Maniaces in the Sicilian expedition of 1038.
118	569	Robert Guiscard, an other Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of Apulia as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern Italy.
118	570	Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church.
118	571	After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages.
118	572	They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way.
118	573	Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans.
118	574	The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival.
118	575	Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city.
118	576	Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium.
118	577	The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there.
118	578	The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica.
118	579	Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy.
118	580	They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and Butrint in 1085, after the death of Robert.
119	581	A few years after the First Crusade, in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail.
119	582	Meanwhile, they occupied Petrela, the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river Deabolis, Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho.
119	583	This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them.
119	584	With their help, the Normans secured the Arbanon passes and opened their way to Dibra.
119	585	The lack of supplies, disease and Byzantine resistance forced Bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines in the city of Deabolis.
120	586	The further decline of Byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185, when a large Norman army invaded Dyrrachium, owing to the betrayal of high Byzantine officials.
120	587	Some time later, Dyrrachium—one of the most important naval bases of the Adriatic—fell again to Byzantine hands.
121	588	The Normans were in contact with England from an early date.
121	589	Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the English Channel.
121	590	This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of Emma, sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy, and King Ethelred II of England.
121	591	Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard.
121	592	His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after Cnut the Great's conquest of the isle.
122	593	When finally Edward the Confessor returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother Harthacnut, he brought with him a Norman-educated mind.
122	594	He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force.
122	595	This concept never really took root, but it is a typical example of the attitudes of Edward.
122	596	He appointed Robert of Jumièges archbishop of Canterbury and made Ralph the Timid earl of Hereford.
122	597	He invited his brother-in-law Eustace II, Count of Boulogne to his court in 1051, an event which resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl Godwin of Wessex.
123	598	In 1066, Duke William II of Normandy conquered England killing King Harold II at the Battle of Hastings.
123	599	The invading Normans and their descendants replaced the Anglo-Saxons as the ruling class of England.
123	600	The nobility of England were part of a single Normans culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel.
123	601	Early Norman kings of England, as Dukes of Normandy, owed homage to the King of France for their land on the continent.
123	602	They considered England to be their most important holding (it brought with it the title of King—an important status symbol).
124	603	Eventually, the Normans merged with the natives, combining languages and traditions.
124	604	In the course of the Hundred Years' War, the Norman aristocracy often identified themselves as English.
124	605	The Anglo-Norman language became distinct from the Latin language, something that was the subject of some humour by Geoffrey Chaucer.
124	606	The Anglo-Norman language was eventually absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon language of their subjects (see Old English) and influenced it, helping (along with the Norse language of the earlier Anglo-Norse settlers and the Latin used by the church) in the development of Middle English.
124	607	It in turn evolved into Modern English.
125	608	The Normans had a profound effect on Irish culture and history after their invasion at Bannow Bay in 1169.
125	609	Initially the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity.
125	610	Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became "more Irish than the Irish themselves."
125	611	The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of Ireland, later known as the Pale, and also built many fine castles and settlements, including Trim Castle and Dublin Castle.
125	612	Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook.
125	613	Norman descendants today can be recognised by their surnames.
125	614	Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County Wexford where the first Norman settlements were established.
125	615	Other Norman names such as Furlong predominate there.
125	616	Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell) derived from the French Norman name Morel.
125	617	Other names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) indicate Norman ancestry.
125	618	These included Fitzgerald, FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, Fitzmaurice.
125	619	Other families bearing such surnames as Barry (de Barra) and De Búrca (Burke) are also of Norman extraction.
126	620	One of the claimants of the English throne opposing William the Conqueror, Edgar Atheling, eventually fled to Scotland.
126	621	King Malcolm III of Scotland married Edgar's sister Margaret, and came into opposition to William who had already disputed Scotland's southern borders.
126	622	William invaded Scotland in 1072, riding as far as Abernethy where he met up with his fleet of ships.
126	623	Malcolm submitted, paid homage to William and surrendered his son Duncan as a hostage, beginning a series of arguments as to whether the Scottish Crown owed allegiance to the King of England.
127	624	Normans came into Scotland, building castles and founding noble families who would provide some future kings, such as Robert the Bruce, as well as founding a considerable number of the Scottish clans.
127	625	King David I of Scotland, whose elder brother Alexander I had married Sybilla of Normandy, was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to Scotland, part of the process some scholars call the "Davidian Revolution".
127	626	Having spent time at the court of Henry I of England (married to David's sister Maud of Scotland), and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair, David had to reward many with lands.
127	627	The process was continued under David's successors, most intensely of all under William the Lion.
127	628	The Norman-derived feudal system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland.
127	629	Scottish families of the names Bruce, Gray, Ramsay, Fraser, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and Gordon to name but a few, and including the later royal House of Stewart, can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.
128	630	Even before the Norman Conquest of England, the Normans had come into contact with Wales.
128	631	Edward the Confessor had set up the aforementioned Ralph as earl of Hereford and charged him with defending the Marches and warring with the Welsh.
128	632	In these original ventures, the Normans failed to make any headway into Wales.
129	633	Subsequent to the Conquest, however, the Marches came completely under the dominance of William's most trusted Norman barons, including Bernard de Neufmarché, Roger of Montgomery in Shropshire and Hugh Lupus in Cheshire.
129	634	These Normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of Wales was at some point subject to Norman interference.
129	635	Norman words, such as baron (barwn), first entered Welsh at that time.
130	636	The legendary religious zeal of the Normans was exercised in religious wars long before the First Crusade carved out a Norman principality in Antioch.
130	637	They were major foreign participants in the Reconquista in Iberia.
130	638	In 1018, Roger de Tosny travelled to the Iberian Peninsula to carve out a state for himself from Moorish lands, but failed.
130	639	In 1064, during the War of Barbastro, William of Montreuil led the papal army and took a huge booty.
131	640	In 1096, Crusaders passing by the siege of Amalfi were joined by Bohemond of Taranto and his nephew Tancred with an army of Italo-Normans.
131	641	Bohemond was the de facto leader of the Crusade during its passage through Asia Minor.
131	642	After the successful Siege of Antioch in 1097, Bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city.
131	643	Tancred was instrumental in the conquest of Jerusalem and he worked for the expansion of the Crusader kingdom in Transjordan and the region of Galilee.
132	644	The conquest of Cyprus by the Anglo-Norman forces of the Third Crusade opened a new chapter in the history of the island, which would be under Western European domination for the following 380 years.
132	645	Although not part of a planned operation, the conquest had much more permanent results than initially expected.
133	646	In April 1191 Richard the Lion-hearted left Messina with a large fleet in order to reach Acre.
133	647	But a storm dispersed the fleet.
133	648	After some searching, it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fiancée Berengaria was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus, together with the wrecks of several other ships, including the treasure ship.
133	649	Survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island's despot Isaac Komnenos.
133	650	On 1 May 1191, Richard's fleet arrived in the port of Limassol on Cyprus.
133	651	He ordered Isaac to release the prisoners and the treasure.
133	652	Isaac refused, so Richard landed his troops and took Limassol.
134	653	Various princes of the Holy Land arrived in Limassol at the same time, in particular Guy de Lusignan.
134	654	All declared their support for Richard provided that he support Guy against his rival Conrad of Montferrat.
134	655	The local barons abandoned Isaac, who considered making peace with Richard, joining him on the crusade, and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by Richard.
134	656	But Isaac changed his mind and tried to escape.
134	657	Richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island, his troops being led by Guy de Lusignan.
134	658	Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains, because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons.
134	659	By 1 June, Richard had conquered the whole island.
134	660	His exploit was well publicized and contributed to his reputation; he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island.
134	661	Richard left for Acre on 5 June, with his allies.
134	662	Before his departure, he named two of his Norman generals, Richard de Camville and Robert de Thornham, as governors of Cyprus.
135	663	While in Limassol, Richard the Lion-Heart married Berengaria of Navarre, first-born daughter of King Sancho VI of Navarre.
135	664	The wedding was held on 12 May 1191 at the Chapel of St. George and it was attended by Richard's sister Joan, whom he had brought from Sicily.
135	665	The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendor.
135	666	Among other grand ceremonies was a double coronation: Richard caused himself to be crowned King of Cyprus, and Berengaria Queen of England and Queen of Cyprus as well.
136	667	The rapid Anglo-Norman conquest proved more important than it seemed.
136	668	The island occupied a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the Holy Land, whose occupation by the Christians could not continue without support from the sea.
136	669	Shortly after the conquest, Cyprus was sold to the Knights Templar and it was subsequently acquired, in 1192, by Guy de Lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom.
136	670	It was only in 1489 that the Venetians acquired full control of the island, which remained a Christian stronghold until the fall of Famagusta in 1571.
137	671	Between 1402 and 1405, the expedition led by the Norman noble Jean de Bethencourt and the Poitevine Gadifer de la Salle conquered the Canarian islands of Lanzarote, Fuerteventura and El Hierro off the Atlantic coast of Africa.
137	672	Their troops were gathered in Normandy, Gascony and were later reinforced by Castilian colonists.
138	673	Bethencourt took the title of King of the Canary Islands, as vassal to Henry III of Castile.
138	674	In 1418, Jean's nephew Maciot de Bethencourt sold the rights to the islands to Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count de Niebla.
139	675	The customary law of Normandy was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of Jersey and Guernsey in the Channel Islands.
139	676	Norman customary law was transcribed in two customaries in Latin by two judges for use by them and their colleagues: These are the Très ancien coutumier (Very ancient customary), authored between 1200 and 1245; and the Grand coutumier de Normandie (Great customary of Normandy, originally Summa de legibus Normanniae in curia laïcali), authored between 1235 and 1245.
140	677	Norman architecture typically stands out as a new stage in the architectural history of the regions they subdued.
140	678	They spread a unique Romanesque idiom to England and Italy, and the encastellation of these regions with keeps in their north French style fundamentally altered the military landscape.
140	679	Their style was characterised by rounded arches, particularly over windows and doorways, and massive proportions.
141	680	In England, the period of Norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the Anglo-Saxon and precedes the Early Gothic.
141	681	In southern Italy, the Normans incorporated elements of Islamic, Lombard, and Byzantine building techniques into their own, initiating a unique style known as Norman-Arab architecture within the Kingdom of Sicily.
142	682	In the visual arts, the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered.
142	683	However, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the Cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts.
142	684	The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy.
142	685	The chief monasteries taking part in this "renaissance" of Norman art and scholarship were Mont-Saint-Michel, Fécamp, Jumièges, Bec, Saint-Ouen, Saint-Evroul, and Saint-Wandrille.
142	686	These centres were in contact with the so-called "Winchester school", which channeled a pure Carolingian artistic tradition to Normandy.
142	687	In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century, Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts, but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.
143	688	The French Wars of Religion in the 16th century and French Revolution in the 18th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this Norman creativity.
143	689	The former, with their violence, caused the wanton destruction of many Norman edifices; the latter, with its assault on religion, caused the purposeful destruction of religious objects of any type, and its destabilisation of society resulted in rampant pillaging.
144	690	By far the most famous work of Norman art is the Bayeux Tapestry, which is not a tapestry but a work of embroidery.
144	691	It was commissioned by Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux and first Earl of Kent, employing natives from Kent who were learned in the Nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the Danish Vikings.
145	692	In Britain, Norman art primarily survives as stonework or metalwork, such as capitals and baptismal fonts.
145	693	In southern Italy, however, Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek, Lombard, and Arab forebears.
145	694	Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo, the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with Arabic inscriptions.
145	695	Many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage.
145	696	Lombard Salerno was a centre of ivorywork in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination.
145	697	Finally should be noted the intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins.
145	698	For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces.
146	699	Normandy was the site of several important developments in the history of classical music in the 11th century.
146	700	Fécamp Abbey and Saint-Evroul Abbey were centres of musical production and education.
146	701	At Fécamp, under two Italian abbots, William of Volpiano and John of Ravenna, the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught.
146	702	It is still the most common form of pitch representation in English- and German-speaking countries today.
146	703	Also at Fécamp, the staff, around which neumes were oriented, was first developed and taught in the 11th century.
146	704	Under the German abbot Isembard, La Trinité-du-Mont became a centre of musical composition.
147	705	At Saint Evroul, a tradition of singing had developed and the choir achieved fame in Normandy.
147	706	Under the Norman abbot Robert de Grantmesnil, several monks of Saint-Evroul fled to southern Italy, where they were patronised by Robert Guiscard and established a Latin monastery at Sant'Eufemia.
147	707	There they continued the tradition of singing.
148	708	Nikola Tesla (Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла; 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.
149	709	Tesla gained experience in telephony and electrical engineering before emigrating to the United States in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison in New York City.
149	710	He soon struck out on his own with financial backers, setting up laboratories and companies to develop a range of electrical devices.
149	711	His patented AC induction motor and transformer were licensed by George Westinghouse, who also hired Tesla for a short time as a consultant.
149	712	His work in the formative years of electric power development was involved in a corporate alternating current/direct current "War of Currents" as well as various patent battles.
150	713	Tesla went on to pursue his ideas of wireless lighting and electricity distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs, and made early (1893) pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices.
150	714	He tried to put these ideas to practical use in an ill-fated attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission, his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project.
150	715	In his lab he also conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging.
150	716	He also built a wireless controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited.
151	717	Tesla was renowned for his achievements and showmanship, eventually earning him a reputation in popular culture as an archetypal "mad scientist".
151	718	His patents earned him a considerable amount of money, much of which was used to finance his own projects with varying degrees of success.
151	719	:121,154 He lived most of his life in a series of New York hotels, through his retirement.
151	720	Tesla died on 7 January 1943.
151	721	His work fell into relative obscurity after his death, but in 1960 the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor.
151	722	There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.
152	723	Tesla was born on 10 July [O.S.
152	724	28 June] 1856 into a Serb family in the village of Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia).
152	725	His father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian Orthodox priest.
152	726	Tesla's mother, Đuka Tesla (née Mandić), whose father was also an Orthodox priest,:10 had a talent for making home craft tools, mechanical appliances, and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems.
152	727	Đuka had never received a formal education.
152	728	Nikola credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence.
152	729	Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.
153	730	Tesla was the fourth of five children.
153	731	He had an older brother named Dane and three sisters, Milka, Angelina and Marica.
153	732	Dane was killed in a horse-riding accident when Nikola was five.
153	733	In 1861, Tesla attended the "Lower" or "Primary" School in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion.
153	734	In 1862, the Tesla family moved to Gospić, Austrian Empire, where Tesla's father worked as a pastor.
153	735	Nikola completed "Lower" or "Primary" School, followed by the "Lower Real Gymnasium" or "Normal School."
154	736	In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac, to attend school at the Higher Real Gymnasium, where he was profoundly influenced by a math teacher Martin Sekulić.
154	737	:32 The classes were held in German, as it was a school within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.
154	738	Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating.
154	739	He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.:33
155	740	In 1873, Tesla returned to his birthtown, Smiljan.
155	741	Shortly after he arrived, Tesla contracted cholera; he was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times.
155	742	Tesla's father, in a moment of despair, promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness (his father had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood).
156	743	In 1874, Tesla evaded being drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan by running away to Tomingaj, near Gračac.
156	744	There, he explored the mountains in hunter's garb.
156	745	Tesla said that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally.
156	746	He read many books while in Tomingaj, and later said that Mark Twain's works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness.
157	747	In 1875, Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, on a Military Frontier scholarship.
157	748	During his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams (nearly twice as many required), started a Serbian culture club, and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, "Your son is a star of first rank."
157	749	Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted.
157	750	He was "mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors."
157	751	After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork.
157	752	During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary.
157	753	At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling.
157	754	During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family.
157	755	Tesla said that he "conquered [his] passion then and there," but later he was known to play billiards in the US.
157	756	When exam time came, Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but was denied.
157	757	He never graduated from the university and did not receive grades for the last semester.
158	758	In December 1878, Tesla left Graz and severed all relations with his family to hide the fact that he dropped out of school.
158	759	His friends thought that he had drowned in the Mur River.
158	760	Tesla went to Maribor (now in Slovenia), where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins a month.
158	761	He spent his spare time playing cards with local men on the streets.
158	762	In March 1879, Milutin Tesla went to Maribor to beg his son to return home, but Nikola refused.
158	763	Nikola suffered a nervous breakdown at around the same time.
159	764	On 24 March 1879, Tesla was returned to Gospić under police guard for not having a residence permit.
159	765	On 17 April 1879, Milutin Tesla died at the age of 60 after contracting an unspecified illness (although some sources say that he died of a stroke).
159	766	During that year, Tesla taught a large class of students in his old school, Higher Real Gymnasium, in Gospić.
160	767	In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put together enough money to help him leave Gospić for Prague where he was to study.
160	768	Unfortunately, he arrived too late to enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University; he never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in Czech, another required subject.
160	769	Tesla did, however, attend lectures at the university, although, as an auditor, he did not receive grades for the courses.
161	770	In 1881, Tesla moved to Budapest to work under Ferenc Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange.
161	771	Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead.
161	772	Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position.
161	773	During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.
162	774	In 1882, Tesla began working for the Continental Edison Company in France, designing and making improvements to electrical equipment.
162	775	In June 1884, he relocated to New York City:57–60 where he was hired by Thomas Edison to work at his Edison Machine Works on Manhattan's lower east side.
162	776	Tesla's work for Edison began with simple electrical engineering and quickly progressed to solving more difficult problems.
163	777	Tesla was offered the task of completely redesigning the Edison Company's direct current generators.
163	778	In 1885, he said that he could redesign Edison's inefficient motor and generators, making an improvement in both service and economy.
163	779	According to Tesla, Edison remarked, "There's fifty thousand dollars in it for you—if you can do it.
163	780	":54–57 :64 This has been noted as an odd statement from an Edison whose company was stingy with pay and who did not have that sort of cash on hand.
163	781	After months of work, Tesla fulfilled the task and inquired about payment.
163	782	Edison, saying that he was only joking, replied, "Tesla, you don't understand our American humor.
163	783	":64  Instead, Edison offered a US$10 a week raise over Tesla's US$18 per week salary; Tesla refused the offer and immediately resigned.
164	784	After leaving Edison's company Tesla partnered with two businessmen in 1886, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an electric lighting company in Tesla's name, Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing.
164	785	The company installed electrical arc light based illumination systems designed by Tesla and also had designs for dynamo electric machine commutators, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US.
165	786	The investors showed little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of motors and electrical transmission equipment and also seemed to think it was better to develop an electrical utility than invent new systems.
165	787	They eventually forced Tesla out leaving him penniless.
165	788	He even lost control of the patents he had generated since he had assigned them to the company in lieu of stock.
165	789	He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and even as a ditch digger for $2 per day.
165	790	Tesla considered the winter of 1886/1887 as a time of "terrible headaches and bitter tears."
165	791	During this time, he questioned the value of his education.
166	792	In late 1886 Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles F. Peck.
166	793	The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain.
166	794	Based on Tesla's patents and other ideas they agreed to back him financially and handle his patents.
166	795	Together in April 1887 they formed the Tesla Electric Company with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go ⅓ to Tesla, ⅓ to Peck and Brown, and ⅓ to fund development.
166	796	They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators and other devices.
167	797	One of the things Tesla developed at that laboratory in 1887 was an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was starting to be built in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission.
167	798	The motor used polyphase current which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882).
167	799	This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.
168	800	In 1888, the editor of Electrical World magazine, Thomas Commerford Martin (a friend and publicist), arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current system, including his induction motor, at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now IEEE).
168	801	Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system — something for which Westinghouse had been trying to secure patents.
168	802	Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor presented in a paper in March 1888 by the Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided Tesla's patent would probably control the market.
169	803	In July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor.
169	804	Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($52,700 in today's dollars) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.
170	805	During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars.
170	806	He found the time there frustrating because of conflicts between him and the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power.
170	807	Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), although they soon found that, since Tesla's induction motor could only run at a constant speed, it would not work for street cars.
170	808	They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.
171	809	Tesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, put Tesla firmly on the "AC" side of the so-called "War of Currents," an electrical distribution battle being waged between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse that had been simmering since Westinghouse's first AC system in 1886 and had reached the point of all-out warfare by 1888.
171	810	This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent.
171	811	The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while.
171	812	The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point.
172	813	In 1893, George Westinghouse won the bid to light the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago with alternating current, beating out a General Electric bid by one million dollars.
172	814	This World's Fair devoted a building to electrical exhibits.
172	815	It was a key event in the history of AC power, as Westinghouse demonstrated the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated alternating current system to the American public.
172	816	At the Columbian Exposition, under a banner announcing the "Tesla Polyphase System", Tesla demonstrated a series of electrical effects previously performed throughout America and Europe,:76 included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp.
173	817	In 1893 Richard Dean Adams, who headed up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls.
173	818	Over several years there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to utilize power generated by the falls with many systems being proposed by several US and European companies including two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and even compressed air.
173	819	Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems.
173	820	Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current.
173	821	Based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration that they could build a complete AC system at the Columbian Exposition, a contract for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls was awarded to Westinghouse Electric.
173	822	A further contract to build the AC distribution system was awarded to General Electric.
174	823	The mid 1890s saw the conglomerate General Electric, backed by financier J. P. Morgan, involved in takeover attempts and patent battles with Westinghouse Electric.
174	824	Although a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 Westinghouse was still cash-strapped from the financial warfare.
174	825	To secure further loans, Westinghouse was forced to revisit Tesla's AC patent, which bankers considered a financial strain on the company (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck).
174	826	In 1897, Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to "deal with the bankers" to try to collect future royalties.
174	827	Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000; this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty.
175	828	On 30 July 1891, at the age of 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States, and established his South Fifth Avenue laboratory, and later another at 46 E. Houston Street, in New York.
175	829	He lit electric lamps wirelessly at both locations, demonstrating the potential of wireless power transmission.
175	830	In the same year, he patented the Tesla coil.
176	831	Tesla served as a vice president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the forerunner (along with the Institute of Radio Engineers) of the modern-day IEEE, from 1892 to 1894.
177	832	Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of "invisible" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments (later identified as "Roentgen rays" or "X-Rays").
177	833	His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube.
177	834	Soon after, much of Tesla's early research—hundreds of invention models, plans, notes, laboratory data, tools, photographs, valued at $50,000—was lost in the 5th Avenue laboratory fire of March 1895.
177	835	Tesla is quoted by The New York Times as saying, "I am in too much grief to talk.
177	836	Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of x-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube.
177	837	The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.
178	838	In March 1896, after hearing of Wilhelm Röntgen's discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging (radiography), Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla Coil (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation).
178	839	In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays.
178	840	Tesla held that, with his circuits, the "instrument will ... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus."
179	841	Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices.
179	842	In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes.
179	843	He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid.
179	844	Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas.
179	845	These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.
180	846	At the beginning of 1893 Westinghouse engineer Benjamin Lamme had made great progress developing an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor and Westinghouse Electric started branding their complete polyphase phase AC system as the "Tesla Polyphase System", noting how they believed Tesla's patents gave them patent priority over other AC systems.
181	847	Tesla also explained the principles of the rotating magnetic field in an induction motor by demonstrating how to make a copper egg stand on end using a device he constructed known as the Egg of Columbus.
182	848	On 11 July 1934, the New York Herald Tribune published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event that would occasionally take place while experimenting with his single-electrode vacuum tubes; a minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him.
182	849	"Tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it passed out."
182	850	In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his "electric gun," Tesla said, "The particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than such particles ... and they will travel in concentrations."
183	851	Tesla's theories on the possibility of the transmission by radio waves go back as far as lectures and demonstrations in 1893 in St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the National Electric Light Association.
183	852	Tesla's demonstrations and principles were written about widely through various media outlets.
183	853	Many devices such as the Tesla Coil were used in the further development of radio.
184	854	In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a radio-controlled boat—which he dubbed "teleautomaton"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden.
184	855	The crowd that witnessed the demonstration made outrageous claims about the workings of the boat, such as magic, telepathy, and being piloted by a trained monkey hidden inside.
184	856	Tesla tried to sell his idea to the U.S. military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest.
184	857	Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military programs.
184	858	Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate "Teleautomatics" in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while he was travelling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.
185	859	In 1900, Tesla was granted patents for a "system of transmitting electrical energy" and "an electrical transmitter."
185	860	When Guglielmo Marconi made his famous first-ever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, Tesla quipped that it was done with 17 Tesla patents, though there is little to support this claim.
185	861	This was the beginning of years of patent battles over radio with Tesla's patents being upheld in 1903, followed by a reverse decision in favor of Marconi in 1904.
185	862	In 1943, a Supreme Court of the United States decision restored the prior patents of Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone.
185	863	The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Tesla's prior patent).
186	864	On 17 May 1899, Tesla moved to Colorado Springs, where he would have room for his high-voltage, high-frequency experiments; his lab was located near Foote Ave. and Kiowa St.
186	865	He chose this location because the polyphase alternating current power distribution system had been introduced there and he had associates who were willing to give him all the power he needed without charging for it.
186	866	Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he was conducting wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris.
186	867	[citation needed] The 1978 book Colorado Springs Notes, 1899–1900 contains descriptions of Tesla's experiments.
186	868	On 15 June 1899, Tesla performed his first experiments at his Colorado Springs lab; he recorded his initial spark length at five inches long, but very thick and noisy.
187	869	Tesla investigated atmospheric electricity, observing lightning signals via his receivers.
187	870	He stated that he observed stationary waves during this time.
187	871	The great distances and the nature of what Tesla was detecting from lightning storms confirmed his belief that the earth had a resonant frequency.
188	872	He produced artificial lightning, with discharges consisting of millions of volts and up to 135 feet long.
188	873	Thunder from the released energy was heard 15 miles away in Cripple Creek, Colorado.
188	874	People walking along the street observed sparks jumping between their feet and the ground.
188	875	Sparks sprang from water line taps when touched.
188	876	Light bulbs within 100 feet of the lab glowed even when turned off.
188	877	Horses in a livery stable bolted from their stalls after receiving shocks through their metal shoes.
188	878	Butterflies were electrified, swirling in circles with blue halos of St. Elmo's fire around their wings.
189	879	While experimenting, Tesla inadvertently faulted a power station generator, causing a power outage.
189	880	In August 1917, Tesla explained what had happened in The Electrical Experimenter: "As an example of what has been done with several hundred kilowatts of high frequency energy liberated, it was found that the dynamos in a power house six miles away were repeatedly burned out, due to the powerful high frequency currents set up in them, and which caused heavy sparks to jump through the windings and destroy the insulation!"
190	881	During his time at his lab, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he concluded may be communications from another planet.
190	882	He mentioned them in a letter to reporter Julian Hawthorne at the Philadelphia North American on 8 December 1899 and in a December 1900 letter about possible discoveries in the new century to the Red Cross Society where he referred to messages "from another world" that read "1... 2... 3...".
190	883	Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars.
190	884	He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article "Talking With Planets" where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing "intelligently controlled signals" and that the signals could come from Mars, Venus, or other planets.
190	885	It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Marconi's European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.
191	886	In 1899, John Jacob Astor IV invested $100,000 for Tesla to further develop and produce a new lighting system.
191	887	Instead, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments.
192	888	On 7 January 1900, Tesla left Colorado Springs.
192	889	[citation needed] His lab was torn down in 1904, and its contents were sold two years later to satisfy a debt.
193	890	The Colorado experiments had prepared Tesla for the establishment of the trans-Atlantic wireless telecommunications facility known as Wardenclyffe near Shoreham, Long Island.
194	891	Tesla later approached Morgan to ask for more funds to build a more powerful transmitter.
194	892	When asked where all the money had gone, Tesla responded by saying that he was affected by the Panic of 1901, which he (Morgan) had caused.
194	893	Morgan was shocked by the reminder of his part in the stock market crash and by Tesla's breach of contract by asking for more funds.
194	894	Tesla wrote another plea to Morgan, but it was also fruitless.
194	895	Morgan still owed Tesla money on the original agreement, and Tesla had been facing foreclosure even before construction of the tower began.
195	896	In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, terminating Tesla's relationship with Morgan.
195	897	Over the next five years, Tesla wrote over 50 letters to Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe.
195	898	Tesla continued the project for another nine months.
195	899	The tower was erected to its full 187 feet (57 m).
195	900	In July 1903, Tesla wrote to Morgan that in addition to wireless communication, Wardenclyffe would be capable of wireless transmission of electric power.
195	901	On 14 October 1904, Morgan finally replied through his secretary, stating, "It will be impossible for [me] to do anything in the matter," after Tesla had written to Morgan when the financier was meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury in an attempt to appeal to his Christian spirit.
196	902	On his 50th birthday in 1906, Tesla demonstrated his 200 horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine.
196	903	During 1910–1911 at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp.
197	904	Tesla invented a steam-powered mechanical oscillator—Tesla's oscillator.
197	905	While experimenting with mechanical oscillators at his Houston Street lab, Tesla allegedly generated a resonance of several buildings.
197	906	As the speed grew, it is said that the machine oscillated at the resonance frequency of his own building and, belatedly realizing the danger, he was forced to use a sledge hammer to terminate the experiment, just as the police arrived.
197	907	:162–164 In February 1912, an article—"Nikola Tesla, Dreamer" by Allan L. Benson—was published in World Today, in which an artist's illustration appears showing the entire earth cracking in half with the caption, "Tesla claims that in a few weeks he could set the earth's crust into such a state of vibration that it would rise and fall hundreds of feet and practically destroy civilization.
197	908	A continuation of this process would, he says, eventually split the earth in two."
198	909	Tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence.
198	910	In 1912, he crafted "a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity," wiring the walls of a schoolroom and, "saturating [the schoolroom] with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency.
198	911	The whole room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or 'bath.'"
198	912	The plan was, at least provisionally approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.
199	913	Before World War I, Tesla sought overseas investors.
199	914	After the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries.
199	915	Eventually, he sold Wardenclyffe for $20,000 ($472,500 in today's dollars).
199	916	In 1917, around the time that the Wardenclyffe Tower was demolished by Boldt to make the land a more viable real estate asset, Tesla received AIEE's highest honor, the Edison Medal.
200	917	In the August 1917 edition of the magazine Electrical Experimenter Tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an "electric ray" of "tremendous frequency," with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar).
200	918	Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water but Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high frequency signal would be needed was correct stating "(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly.
201	919	On 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg "for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays.
201	920	":245 There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that Tesla and/or Edison had refused the prize.
201	921	:245 The Nobel Foundation said, "Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous"; a recipient could only decline a Nobel Prize after he is announced a winner.
202	922	There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.
203	923	In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won the prize (although Edison did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and Tesla did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1937).
204	924	In 1928, Tesla received his last patent, U.S. Patent 1,655,114, for a biplane capable of taking off vertically (VTOL aircraft) and then be "gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices" in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane.
204	925	Tesla thought the plane would sell for less than $1,000.
204	926	:251 Although the aircraft was probably impractical, it may be the earliest known design for what became the tiltrotor/tilt-wing concept as well as the earliest proposal for the use of turbine engines in rotor aircraft.
205	927	Starting in 1934, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company began paying Tesla $125 per month as well as paying his rent at the Hotel New Yorker, expenses the Company would pay for the rest of Tesla's life.
205	928	Accounts on how this came about vary.
205	929	Several sources say Westinghouse was worried about potential bad publicity surrounding the impoverished conditions their former star inventor was living under.
205	930	It has been described as being couched in the form of a "consulting fee" to get around Tesla's aversion to accept charity, or by one biographer (Marc Seifer), as a type of unspecified settlement.
206	931	In 1935, in an annual birthday celebration interview, Tesla announced a method of transmitting mechanical energy with minimal loss over any terrestrial distance, a related new means of communication, and a method of accurately determining the location of underground mineral deposits.
207	932	In the fall of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons.
207	933	While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown heavily to the ground.
207	934	Tesla's back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident (the full extent of his injuries will never be known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor—an almost lifelong custom).
207	935	Tesla didn't raise any question as to who was at fault and refused medical aid, only asking to be taken to his hotel via cab.
207	936	Tesla was bedridden for some months and was unable to continue feeding pigeons from his window; soon, they failed to come.
207	937	In early 1938, Tesla was able to get up.
207	938	He at once resumed the pigeon-feeding walks on a much more limited scale, but frequently had a messenger act for him.
208	939	Later in life, Tesla made claims concerning a "teleforce" weapon after studying the Van de Graaff generator.
208	940	The press variably referred to it as a "peace ray" or death ray.
208	941	Tesla described the weapon as capable of being used against ground-based infantry or for anti-aircraft purposes.
209	942	In 1937, at a luncheon in his honor concerning the death ray, Tesla stated, "But it is not an experiment ...
209	943	I have built, demonstrated and used it.
209	944	Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world."
209	945	His records indicate that the device is based on a narrow stream of small tungsten pellets that are accelerated via high voltage (by means akin to his magnifying transformer).
210	946	During the same year, Tesla wrote a treatise, The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, concerning charged particle beam weapons.
210	947	Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a "superweapon that would put an end to all war."
210	948	This treatise is currently in the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade.
210	949	It describes an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non-dispersive particle streams (through electrostatic repulsion).
210	950	Tesla tried to interest the US War Department, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.
211	951	During the period in which the negotiations were being conducted, Tesla said that efforts had been made to steal the invention.
211	952	His room had been entered and his papers had been scrutinized, but the thieves, or spies, left empty-handed.
211	953	He said that there was no danger that his invention could be stolen, for he had at no time committed any part of it to paper; the blueprint for the teleforce weapon was all in his mind.
212	954	On 7 January 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel.
212	955	His body was later found by maid Alice Monaghan after she had entered Tesla's room, ignoring the "do not disturb" sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days earlier.
212	956	Wembly examined the body and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis.
212	957	Tesla's remains were taken to the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home at Madison Ave. and 81st St. A long-time friend and supporter of Tesla, Hugo Gernsback, commissioned a sculptor to create a death mask, now displayed in the Nikola Tesla Museum.
213	958	Two days later, the FBI ordered the Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla's belongings, even though Tesla was an American citizen.
213	959	Tesla's entire estate from the Hotel New Yorker and other New York City hotels was transported to the Manhattan Storage and Warehouse Company under the Office of Alien Property (OAP) seal.
213	960	John G. Trump, a professor at M.I.T.
213	961	and a well-known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, was called in to analyze the Tesla items in OAP custody.
213	962	After a three-day investigation, Trump's report concluded that there was nothing which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands, stating:
214	963	On 10 January 1943, New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia read a eulogy written by Slovene-American author Louis Adamic live over the WNYC radio while violin pieces "Ave Maria" and "Tamo daleko" were played in the background.
214	964	On 12 January, two thousand people attended a state funeral for Tesla at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine.
214	965	After the funeral, Tesla's body was taken to the Ferncliff Cemetery in Ardsley, New York, where it was later cremated.
214	966	The following day, a second service was conducted by prominent priests in the Trinity Chapel (today's Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sava) in New York City.
215	967	In 1952, following pressure from Tesla's nephew, Sava Kosanović, Tesla's entire estate was shipped to Belgrade in 80 trunks marked N.T.
215	968	In 1957, Kosanović's secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla's ashes from the United States to Belgrade.
215	969	The ashes are displayed in a gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the Nikola Tesla Museum.
216	970	Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions.
216	971	Some of Tesla's patents are not accounted for, and various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives.
216	972	There are a minimum of 278 patents issued to Tesla in 26 countries that have been accounted for.
216	973	Many of Tesla's patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe.
216	974	:62 Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.
217	975	Tesla worked every day from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. or later, with dinner from exactly 8:10 p.m., at Delmonico's restaurant and later the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
217	976	Tesla would telephone his dinner order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve him.
217	977	"The meal was required to be ready at eight o'clock ...
217	978	He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations.
217	979	Tesla would then resume his work, often until 3:00 a.m.":283, 286
218	980	For exercise, Tesla walked between 8 to 10 miles per day.
218	981	He squished his toes one hundred times for each foot every night, saying that it stimulated his brain cells.
219	982	In an interview with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Tesla said that he did not believe in telepathy, stating, "Suppose I made up my mind to murder you," he said, "In a second you would know it.
219	983	By what process does the mind get at all this?"
219	984	In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.
220	985	Near the end of his life, Tesla walked to the park every day to feed the pigeons and even brought injured ones into his hotel room to nurse back to health.
220	986	He said that he had been visited by a specific injured white pigeon daily.
220	987	Tesla spent over $2,000, including building a device that comfortably supported her so her bones could heal, to fix her broken wing and leg.
221	988	Tesla was 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighed 142 pounds (64 kg), with almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926.:292 He was an elegant, stylish figure in New York City, meticulous in his grooming, clothing, and regimented in his daily activities.
222	989	Tesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory.
222	990	:33 He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin.
222	991	:282 Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration.
222	992	During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness.
222	993	He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions.
222	994	:33 Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered.
222	995	Just by hearing the name of an item, he would be able to envision it in realistic detail.
222	996	:33 Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking.
222	997	He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory.
222	998	Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.
223	999	During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed a passion for (and became very proficient at) billiards, chess and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table.
223	1000	:43, 301 On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without sleep or rest.
223	1001	:208 Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept.
223	1002	Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: "I was sleeping in my room like one dead ...
223	1003	Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me ... [Tesla] spoke animatedly, with pauses, [as he] ... work[ed] out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution, he suddenly closed the telephone."
224	1004	Tesla never married; he said his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities.
224	1005	:33 However, toward the end of his life, he told a reporter, "Sometimes I feel that by not marrying, I made too great a sacrifice to my work ..." There have been numerous accounts of women vying for Tesla's affection, even some madly in love with him.
224	1006	[citation needed] Tesla, though polite and soft-spoken, did not have any known relationships.
225	1007	Tesla was asocial and prone to seclude himself with his work.
225	1008	However, when he did engage in a social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of Tesla.
225	1009	Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a "distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force."
225	1010	His loyal secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: "his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul."
225	1011	Tesla's friend, Julian Hawthorne, wrote, "seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink.
226	1012	Tesla was a good friend of Francis Marion Crawford, Robert Underwood Johnson, Stanford White, Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey.
226	1013	In middle age, Tesla became a close friend of Mark Twain; they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere.
226	1014	Twain notably described Tesla's induction motor invention as "the most valuable patent since the telephone."
226	1015	In the late 1920s, Tesla also befriended George Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a Nazi propagandist.
226	1016	Tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife.
227	1017	Tesla could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people, such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight.
227	1018	:110 He was quick to criticize clothing; on several occasions, Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress.
228	1019	Tesla exhibited a pre-atomic understanding of physics in his writings; he disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge (he believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or "sub-atom" that could only exist in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity).
228	1020	:249 Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way.
228	1021	He was a believer in the 19th century concept of an all pervasive "ether" that transmitted electrical energy.
229	1022	Tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy.
229	1023	:247 He was also critical of Einstein's theory of relativity, saying:
230	1024	Tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892, and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a "dynamic theory of gravity" that "[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space."
230	1025	He stated that the theory was "worked out in all details" and that he hoped to soon give it to the world.
230	1026	Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.
231	1027	Tesla, like many of his era, became a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics.
231	1028	His opinion stemmed from the belief that humans' "pity" had interfered with the natural "ruthless workings of nature," rather than from conceptions of a "master race" or inherent superiority of one person over another.
231	1029	His advocacy of it was, however, to push it further.
231	1030	In a 1937 interview, he stated:
232	1031	In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity's future would be run by "Queen Bees."
232	1032	He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.
233	1033	Tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article, "Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War" (20 December 1914).
233	1034	Tesla believed that the League of Nations was not a remedy for the times and issues.
234	1035	Tesla was raised an Orthodox Christian.
234	1036	Later in his life, he did not consider himself to be a "believer in the orthodox sense," and opposed religious fanaticism.
234	1037	Despite this, he had a profound respect for both Buddhism and Christianity.
235	1038	However, his religious views remain uncertain due to other statements that he made.
235	1039	For example, in his article, "A Machine to End War", published in 1937, Tesla stated:
236	1040	Tesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals.
236	1041	Among his books are My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, compiled and edited by Ben Johnston; The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla, compiled and edited by David Hatcher Childress; and The Tesla Papers.
237	1042	Many of Tesla's writings are freely available on the web, including the article "The Problem of Increasing Human Energy," published in The Century Magazine in 1900, and the article "Experiments With Alternate Currents Of High Potential And High Frequency," published in his book Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla.
238	1043	Tesla's legacy has endured in books, films, radio, TV, music, live theater, comics and video games.
238	1044	The impact of the technologies invented or envisioned by Tesla is a recurring theme in several types of science fiction.
239	1045	On Tesla's 75th birthday in 1931, Time magazine put him on its cover.
239	1046	The cover caption "All the world's his power house" noted his contribution to electrical power generation.
239	1047	He received congratulatory letters from more than 70 pioneers in science and engineering, including Albert Einstein.
240	1048	Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other.
240	1049	A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.
241	1050	A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used.
241	1051	The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage.
241	1052	Other complexity measures are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing).
241	1053	One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do.
242	1054	Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory.
242	1055	A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem.
242	1056	More precisely, it tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources.
242	1057	In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kind of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.
243	1058	A computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a solution for every instance.
243	1059	The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself.
243	1060	In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved.
243	1061	In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem.
243	1062	For example, consider the problem of primality testing.
243	1063	The instance is a number (e.g.
243	1064	15) and the solution is "yes" if the number is prime and "no" otherwise (in this case "no").
243	1065	Stated another way, the instance is a particular input to the problem, and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input.
244	1066	To further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities?
244	1067	The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in Milan whose total length is at most 10 km.
244	1068	For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.
245	1069	When considering computational problems, a problem instance is a string over an alphabet.
245	1070	Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are bitstrings.
245	1071	As in a real-world computer, mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded.
245	1072	For example, integers can be represented in binary notation, and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices, or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary.
246	1073	Decision problems are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory.
246	1074	A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no, or alternately either 1 or 0.
246	1075	A decision problem can be viewed as a formal language, where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no.
246	1076	The objective is to decide, with the aid of an algorithm, whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration.
246	1077	If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes, the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.
247	1078	An example of a decision problem is the following.
247	1079	The input is an arbitrary graph.
247	1080	The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is connected, or not.
247	1081	The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs—of course, to obtain a precise definition of this language, one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings.
248	1082	A function problem is a computational problem where a single output (of a total function) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem, that is, it isn't just yes or no.
248	1083	Notable examples include the traveling salesman problem and the integer factorization problem.
249	1084	It is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems.
249	1085	However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems.
249	1086	For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (a, b, c) such that the relation a × b = c holds.
249	1087	Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.
250	1088	To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem.
250	1089	However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance.
250	1090	In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve.
250	1091	Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance.
250	1092	This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits.
250	1093	Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size.
250	1094	For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2n vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with n vertices?
251	1095	If the input size is n, the time taken can be expressed as a function of n. Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different, the worst-case time complexity T(n) is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n. If T(n) is a polynomial in n, then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm.
251	1096	Cobham's thesis says that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm.
252	1097	A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine.
252	1098	It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape.
252	1099	Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper.
252	1100	It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem.
252	1101	Indeed, this is the statement of the Church–Turing thesis.
252	1102	Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine.
252	1103	Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.
253	1104	A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions.
253	1105	A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits.
253	1106	The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently.
253	1107	Algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms.
253	1108	A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state.
253	1109	One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches, it is said to have solved the problem.
253	1110	Clearly, this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model, it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes.
254	1111	Many types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as deterministic Turing machines, probabilistic Turing machines, non-deterministic Turing machines, quantum Turing machines, symmetric Turing machines and alternating Turing machines.
254	1112	They are all equally powerful in principle, but when resources (such as time or space) are bounded, some of these may be more powerful than others.
255	1113	Many machine models different from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random access machines.
255	1114	Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power.
255	1115	The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary.
255	1116	What all these models have in common is that the machines operate deterministically.
256	1117	However, some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources.
256	1118	For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once.
256	1119	The non-deterministic Turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that non-deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems.
257	1120	For a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the deterministic Turing machine is used.
257	1121	The time required by a deterministic Turing machine M on input x is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer ("yes" or "no").
257	1122	A Turing machine M is said to operate within time f(n), if the time required by M on each input of length n is at most f(n).
257	1123	A decision problem A can be solved in time f(n) if there exists a Turing machine operating in time f(n) that solves the problem.
257	1124	Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria.
257	1125	For instance, the set of problems solvable within time f(n) on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIME(f(n)).
258	1126	Analogous definitions can be made for space requirements.
258	1127	Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources, any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource.
258	1128	Complexity measures are very generally defined by the Blum complexity axioms.
258	1129	Other complexity measures used in complexity theory include communication complexity, circuit complexity, and decision tree complexity.
259	1130	The best, worst and average case complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity (or any other complexity measure) of different inputs of the same size.
259	1131	Since some inputs of size n may be faster to solve than others, we define the following complexities:
260	1132	For example, consider the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort.
260	1133	This solves the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input.
260	1134	The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time O(n2) for this case.
260	1135	If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(n log n).
260	1136	The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(n log n) time.
261	1137	To classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem.
261	1138	The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity, unless specified otherwise.
261	1139	Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms.
261	1140	To show an upper bound T(n) on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most T(n).
261	1141	However, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem.
261	1142	The phrase "all possible algorithms" includes not just the algorithms known today, but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future.
261	1143	To show a lower bound of T(n) for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than T(n).
262	1144	Upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big O notation, which hides constant factors and smaller terms.
262	1145	This makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used.
262	1146	For instance, if T(n) = 7n2 + 15n + 40, in big O notation one would write T(n) = O(n2).
263	1147	Of course, some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework.
263	1148	Thus, a typical complexity class has a definition like the following:
264	1149	But bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f(n) often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model.
264	1150	For instance, the language {xx | x is any binary string} can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines.
264	1151	If we allow polynomial variations in running time, Cobham-Edmonds thesis states that "the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related" (Goldreich 2008, Chapter 1.2).
264	1152	This forms the basis for the complexity class P, which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time.
264	1153	The corresponding set of function problems is FP.
265	1154	Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm.
265	1155	Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:
266	1156	Other important complexity classes include BPP, ZPP and RP, which are defined using probabilistic Turing machines; AC and NC, which are defined using Boolean circuits; and BQP and QMA, which are defined using quantum Turing machines.
266	1157	#P is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).
266	1158	Classes like IP and AM are defined using Interactive proof systems.
266	1159	ALL is the class of all decision problems.
267	1160	For the complexity classes defined in this way, it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems.
267	1161	In particular, although DTIME(n) is contained in DTIME(n2), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict.
267	1162	For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively.
267	1163	They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources.
267	1164	Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other.
267	1165	Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.
268	1166	The time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes.
268	1167	For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME, and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that L is strictly contained in PSPACE.
269	1168	Many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction.
269	1169	A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem.
269	1170	It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem.
269	1171	For instance, if a problem X can be solved using an algorithm for Y, X is no more difficult than Y, and we say that X reduces to Y.
269	1172	There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions.
270	1173	The most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction.
270	1174	This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time.
270	1175	For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers.
270	1176	This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer.
270	1177	Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm.
270	1178	Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.
271	1179	This motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class.
271	1180	A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X.
271	1181	Thus no problem in C is harder than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used.
271	1182	For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used.
271	1183	In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.
272	1184	This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π1 would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π2.
272	1185	Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P = NP.
273	1186	The complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm.
273	1187	This hypothesis is called the Cobham–Edmonds thesis.
273	1188	The complexity class NP, on the other hand, contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently, but for which no efficient algorithm is known, such as the Boolean satisfiability problem, the Hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem.
273	1189	Since deterministic Turing machines are special non-deterministic Turing machines, it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP.
274	1190	The question of whether P equals NP is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide implications of a solution.
274	1191	If the answer is yes, many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions.
274	1192	These include various types of integer programming problems in operations research, many problems in logistics, protein structure prediction in biology, and the ability to find formal proofs of pure mathematics theorems.
274	1193	The P versus NP problem is one of the Millennium Prize Problems proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute.
274	1194	There is a US$1,000,000 prize for resolving the problem.
275	1195	It was shown by Ladner that if P ≠ NP then there exist problems in NP that are neither in P nor NP-complete.
275	1196	Such problems are called NP-intermediate problems.
275	1197	The graph isomorphism problem, the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate.
275	1198	They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in P or to be NP-complete.
276	1199	The graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic.
276	1200	An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate.
276	1201	The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete.
276	1202	If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level.
276	1203	Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete.
276	1204	The best algorithm for this problem, due to Laszlo Babai and Eugene Luks has run time 2O(√(n log(n))) for graphs with n vertices.
277	1205	The integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer.
277	1206	Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm.
277	1207	The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP (and even in UP and co-UP).
277	1208	If the problem is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., NP will equal co-NP).
277	1209	The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes time O(e(64/9)1/3(n.log 2)1/3(log (n.log 2))2/3) to factor an n-bit integer.
277	1210	However, the best known quantum algorithm for this problem, Shor's algorithm, does run in polynomial time.
277	1211	Unfortunately, this fact doesn't say much about where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.
278	1212	Many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal, but this has not been proved.
278	1213	For instance P ⊆ NP ⊆ PP ⊆ PSPACE, but it is possible that P = PSPACE.
278	1214	If P is not equal to NP, then P is not equal to PSPACE either.
278	1215	Since there are many known complexity classes between P and PSPACE, such as RP, BPP, PP, BQP, MA, PH, etc., it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class.
278	1216	Proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory.
279	1217	Along the same lines, co-NP is the class containing the complement problems (i.e.
279	1218	problems with the yes/no answers reversed) of NP problems.
279	1219	It is believed that NP is not equal to co-NP; however, it has not yet been proven.
279	1220	It has been shown that if these two complexity classes are not equal then P is not equal to NP.
280	1221	Similarly, it is not known if L (the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space) is strictly contained in P or equal to P. Again, there are many complexity classes between the two, such as NL and NC, and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes.
281	1222	Problems that can be solved in theory (e.g., given large but finite time), but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful, are known as intractable problems.
281	1223	In complexity theory, problems that lack polynomial-time solutions are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs.
281	1224	In fact, the Cobham–Edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device.
281	1225	Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIME-hard.
281	1226	If NP is not the same as P, then the NP-complete problems are also intractable in this sense.
281	1227	To see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting.
281	1228	For small n, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4 × 1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe.
281	1229	Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress.
281	1230	Nevertheless, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical.
281	1231	If its running time is, say, n15, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances.
282	1232	What intractability means in practice is open to debate.
282	1233	Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are.
282	1234	For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases.
282	1235	Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem.
283	1236	Before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off, numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers.
283	1237	Most influential among these was the definition of Turing machines by Alan Turing in 1936, which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer.
284	1238	As Fortnow & Homer (2003) point out, the beginning of systematic studies in computational complexity is attributed to the seminal paper "On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms" by Juris Hartmanis and Richard Stearns (1965), which laid out the definitions of time and space complexity and proved the hierarchy theorems.
284	1239	Also, in 1965 Edmonds defined a "good" algorithm as one with running time bounded by a polynomial of the input size.
285	1240	Earlier papers studying problems solvable by Turing machines with specific bounded resources include  John Myhill's definition of linear bounded automata (Myhill 1960), Raymond Smullyan's study of rudimentary sets (1961), as well as Hisao Yamada's paper on real-time computations (1962).
285	1241	Somewhat earlier, Boris Trakhtenbrot (1956), a pioneer in the field from the USSR, studied another specific complexity measure.
286	1242	Even though some proofs of complexity-theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding, one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding.
286	1243	This can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently.
287	1244	In 1967, Manuel Blum developed an axiomatic complexity theory based on his axioms and proved an important result, the so-called, speed-up theorem.
287	1245	The field really began to flourish in 1971 when the US researcher Stephen Cook and, working independently, Leonid Levin in the USSR, proved that there exist practically relevant problems that are NP-complete.
287	1246	In 1972, Richard Karp took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper, "Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems", in which he showed that 21 diverse combinatorial and graph theoretical problems, each infamous for its computational intractability, are NP-complete.
288	1247	The role of teacher is often formal and ongoing, carried out at a school or other place of formal education.
288	1248	In many countries, a person who wishes to become a teacher must first obtain specified professional qualifications or credentials from a university or college.
288	1249	These professional qualifications may include the study of pedagogy, the science of teaching.
288	1250	Teachers, like other professionals, may have to continue their education after they qualify, a process known as continuing professional development.
288	1251	Teachers may use a lesson plan to facilitate student learning, providing a course of study which is called the curriculum.
289	1252	A teacher's role may vary among cultures.
289	1253	Teachers may provide instruction in literacy and numeracy, craftsmanship or vocational training, the arts, religion, civics, community roles, or life skills.
290	1254	In some countries, formal education can take place through home schooling.
290	1255	Informal learning may be assisted by a teacher occupying a transient or ongoing role, such as a family member, or by anyone with knowledge or skills in the wider community setting.
291	1256	Religious and spiritual teachers, such as gurus, mullahs, rabbis, pastors/youth pastors and lamas, may teach religious texts such as the Quran, Torah or Bible.
292	1257	Teaching may be carried out informally, within the family, which is called homeschooling, or in the wider community.
292	1258	Formal teaching may be carried out by paid professionals.
292	1259	Such professionals enjoy a status in some societies on a par with physicians, lawyers, engineers, and accountants (Chartered or CPA).
293	1260	A teacher's professional duties may extend beyond formal teaching.
293	1261	Outside of the classroom teachers may accompany students on field trips, supervise study halls, help with the organization of school functions, and serve as supervisors for extracurricular activities.
293	1262	In some education systems, teachers may have responsibility for student discipline.
294	1263	There are a variety of bodies designed to instill, preserve and update the knowledge and professional standing of teachers.
294	1264	Around the world many governments operate teacher's colleges, which are generally established to serve and protect the public interest through certifying, governing and enforcing the standards of practice for the teaching profession.
295	1265	The functions of the teacher's colleges may include setting out clear standards of practice, providing for the ongoing education of teachers, investigating complaints involving members, conducting hearings into allegations of professional misconduct and taking appropriate disciplinary action and accrediting teacher education programs.
295	1266	In many situations teachers in publicly funded schools must be members in good standing with the college, and private schools may also require their teachers to be college peoples.
295	1267	In other areas these roles may belong to the State Board of Education, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the State Education Agency or other governmental bodies.
295	1268	In still other areas Teaching Unions may be responsible for some or all of these duties.
296	1269	In education, teachers facilitate student learning, often in a school or academy or perhaps in another environment such as outdoors.
296	1270	A teacher who teaches on an individual basis may be described as a tutor.
297	1271	The objective is typically accomplished through either an informal or formal approach to learning, including a course of study and lesson plan that teaches skills, knowledge and/or thinking skills.
297	1272	Different ways to teach are often referred to as pedagogy.
297	1273	When deciding what teaching method to use teachers consider students' background knowledge, environment, and their learning goals as well as standardized curricula as determined by the relevant authority.
297	1274	Many times, teachers assist in learning outside of the classroom by accompanying students on field trips.
297	1275	The increasing use of technology, specifically the rise of the internet over the past decade, has begun to shape the way teachers approach their roles in the classroom.
298	1276	The objective is typically a course of study, lesson plan, or a practical skill.
298	1277	A teacher may follow standardized curricula as determined by the relevant authority.
298	1278	The teacher may interact with students of different ages, from infants to adults, students with different abilities and students with learning disabilities.
299	1279	Teaching using pedagogy also involve assessing the educational levels of the students on particular skills.
299	1280	Understanding the pedagogy of the students in a classroom involves using differentiated instruction as well as supervision to meet the needs of all students in the classroom.
299	1281	Pedagogy can be thought of in two manners.
299	1282	First, teaching itself can be taught in many different ways, hence, using a pedagogy of teaching styles.
299	1283	Second, the pedagogy of the learners comes into play when a teacher assesses the pedagogic diversity of his/her students and differentiates for the individual students accordingly.
299	1284	For example, an experienced teacher and parent described the place of a teacher in learning as follows: "The real bulk of learning takes place in self-study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop.
299	1285	The function of the teacher is to pressure the lazy, inspire the bored, deflate the cocky, encourage the timid, detect and correct individual flaws, and broaden the viewpoint of all.
299	1286	This function looks like that of a coach using the whole gamut of psychology to get each new class of rookies off the bench and into the game."
300	1287	Perhaps the most significant difference between primary school and secondary school teaching is the relationship between teachers and children.
300	1288	In primary schools each class has a teacher who stays with them for most of the week and will teach them the whole curriculum.
300	1289	In secondary schools they will be taught by different subject specialists each session during the week and may have ten or more different teachers.
300	1290	The relationship between children and their teachers tends to be closer in the primary school where they act as form tutor, specialist teacher and surrogate parent during the course of the day.
301	1291	This is true throughout most of the United States as well.
301	1292	However, alternative approaches for primary education do exist.
301	1293	One of these, sometimes referred to as a "platoon" system, involves placing a group of students together in one class that moves from one specialist to another for every subject.
301	1294	The advantage here is that students learn from teachers who specialize in one subject and who tend to be more knowledgeable in that one area than a teacher who teaches many subjects.
301	1295	Students still derive a strong sense of security by staying with the same group of peers for all classes.
302	1296	Co-teaching has also become a new trend amongst educational institutions.
302	1297	Co-teaching is defined as two or more teachers working harmoniously to fulfill the needs of every student in the classroom.
302	1298	Co-teaching focuses the student on learning by providing a social networking support that allows them to reach their full cognitive potential.
302	1299	Co-teachers work in sync with one another to create a climate of learning.
303	1300	Throughout the history of education the most common form of school discipline was corporal punishment.
303	1301	While a child was in school, a teacher was expected to act as a substitute parent, with all the normal forms of parental discipline open to them.
304	1302	In past times, corporal punishment (spanking or paddling or caning or strapping or birching the student in order to cause physical pain) was one of the most common forms of school discipline throughout much of the world.
304	1303	Most Western countries, and some others, have now banned it, but it remains lawful in the United States following a US Supreme Court decision in 1977 which held that paddling did not violate the US Constitution.
305	1304	30 US states have banned corporal punishment, the others (mostly in the South) have not.
305	1305	It is still used to a significant (though declining) degree in some public schools in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas.
305	1306	Private schools in these and most other states may also use it.
305	1307	Corporal punishment in American schools is administered to the seat of the student's trousers or skirt with a specially made wooden paddle.
305	1308	This often used to take place in the classroom or hallway, but nowadays the punishment is usually given privately in the principal's office.
306	1309	Official corporal punishment, often by caning, remains commonplace in schools in some Asian, African and Caribbean countries.
306	1310	For details of individual countries see School corporal punishment.
307	1311	Currently detention is one of the most common punishments in schools in the United States, the UK, Ireland, Singapore and other countries.
307	1312	It requires the pupil to remain in school at a given time in the school day (such as lunch, recess or after school); or even to attend school on a non-school day, e.g.
307	1313	"Saturday detention" held at some schools.
307	1314	During detention, students normally have to sit in a classroom and do work, write lines or a punishment essay, or sit quietly.
308	1315	A modern example of school discipline in North America and Western Europe relies upon the idea of an assertive teacher who is prepared to impose their will upon a class.
308	1316	Positive reinforcement is balanced with immediate and fair punishment for misbehavior and firm, clear boundaries define what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior.
308	1317	Teachers are expected to respect their students; sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils are seen as falling outside of what constitutes reasonable discipline.
309	1318	Whilst this is the consensus viewpoint amongst the majority of academics, some teachers and parents advocate a more assertive and confrontational style of discipline.
309	1319	[citation needed] Such individuals claim that many problems with modern schooling stem from the weakness in school discipline and if teachers exercised firm control over the classroom they would be able to teach more efficiently.
309	1320	This viewpoint is supported by the educational attainment of countries—in East Asia for instance—that combine strict discipline with high standards of education.
310	1321	It's not clear, however that this stereotypical view reflects the reality of East Asian classrooms or that the educational goals in these countries are commensurable with those in Western countries.
310	1322	In Japan, for example, although average attainment on standardized tests may exceed those in Western countries, classroom discipline and behavior is highly problematic.
310	1323	Although, officially, schools have extremely rigid codes of behavior, in practice many teachers find the students unmanageable and do not enforce discipline at all.
311	1324	Where school class sizes are typically 40 to 50 students, maintaining order in the classroom can divert the teacher from instruction, leaving little opportunity for concentration and focus on what is being taught.
311	1325	In response, teachers may concentrate their attention on motivated students, ignoring attention-seeking and disruptive students.
311	1326	The result of this is that motivated students, facing demanding university entrance examinations, receive disproportionate resources.
311	1327	Given the emphasis on attainment of university places, administrators and governors may regard this policy as appropriate.
312	1328	Sudbury model democratic schools claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike.
312	1329	They also claim that in these schools the preservation of public order is easier and more efficient than anywhere else.
312	1330	Primarily because rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole, thence the school atmosphere is one of persuasion and negotiation, rather than confrontation since there is no one to confront.
312	1331	Sudbury model democratic schools' proponents argue that a school that has good, clear laws, fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community, and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws, is a school in which community discipline prevails, and in which an increasingly sophisticated concept of law and order develops, against other schools today, where rules are arbitrary, authority is absolute, punishment is capricious, and due process of law is unknown.
313	1332	Since teachers can affect how students perceive the course materials, it has been found that teachers who showed enthusiasm towards the course materials and students can affect a positive learning experience towards the course materials.
313	1333	On teacher/course evaluations, it was found that teachers who have a positive disposition towards the course content tend to transfer their passion to receptive students.
313	1334	These teachers do not teach by rote but attempt to find new invigoration for the course materials on a daily basis.
313	1335	One of the difficulties in this approach is that teachers may have repeatedly covered a curriculum until they begin to feel bored with the subject which in turn bores the students as well.
313	1336	Students who had enthusiastic teachers tend to rate them higher than teachers who didn't show much enthusiasm for the course materials.
314	1337	Teachers that exhibit enthusiasm can lead to students who are more likely to be engaged, interested, energetic, and curious about learning the subject matter.
314	1338	Recent research has found a correlation between teacher enthusiasm and students' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom.
314	1339	Controlled, experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm, such as demonstrative gesturing, dramatic movements which are varied, and emotional facial expressions, result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn.
314	1340	Students who experienced a very enthusiastic teacher were more likely to read lecture material outside of the classroom.
315	1341	There are various mechanisms by which teacher enthusiasm may facilitate higher levels of intrinsic motivation.
315	1342	Teacher enthusiasm may contribute to a classroom atmosphere full of energy and enthusiasm which feed student interest and excitement in learning the subject matter.
315	1343	Enthusiastic teachers may also lead to students becoming more self-determined in their own learning process.
315	1344	The concept of mere exposure indicates that the teacher's enthusiasm may contribute to the student's expectations about intrinsic motivation in the context of learning.
315	1345	Also, enthusiasm may act as a "motivational embellishment"; increasing a student's interest by the variety, novelty, and surprise of the enthusiastic teacher's presentation of the material.
315	1346	Finally, the concept of emotional contagion, may also apply.
315	1347	Students may become more intrinsically motivated by catching onto the enthusiasm and energy of the teacher.
316	1348	Research shows that student motivation and attitudes towards school are closely linked to student-teacher relationships.
316	1349	Enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students.
316	1350	Their ability to create effective learning environments that foster student achievement depends on the kind of relationship they build with their students.
316	1351	Useful teacher-to-student interactions are crucial in linking academic success with personal achievement.
316	1352	Here, personal success is a student's internal goal of improving himself, whereas academic success includes the goals he receives from his superior.
316	1353	A teacher must guide his student in aligning his personal goals with his academic goals.
316	1354	Students who receive this positive influence show stronger self-confidence and greater personal and academic success than those without these teacher interactions.
317	1355	Students are likely to build stronger relations with teachers who are friendly and supportive and will show more interest in courses taught by these teachers.
317	1356	Teachers that spend more time interacting and working directly with students are perceived as supportive and effective teachers.
317	1357	Effective teachers have been shown to invite student participation and decision making, allow humor into their classroom, and demonstrate a willingness to play.
318	1358	The way a teacher promotes the course they are teaching, the more the student will get out of the subject matter.
318	1359	The three most important aspects of teacher enthusiasm are enthusiasm about teaching, enthusiasm about the students, and enthusiasm about the subject matter.
318	1360	If they do not enjoy what they are doing, the students will be able to tell.
318	1361	They also must enjoy being around their students.
318	1362	A teacher who cares for their students is going to help that individual succeed in their life in the future.
318	1363	The teacher also needs to be enthusiastic about the subject matter they are teaching.
318	1364	For example, a teacher talking about chemistry needs to enjoy the art of chemistry and show that to their students.
318	1365	A spark in the teacher may create a spark of excitement in the student as well.
318	1366	An enthusiastic teacher has the ability to be very influential in the young students life.
319	1367	Misconduct by teachers, especially sexual misconduct, has been getting increased scrutiny from the media and the courts.
319	1368	A study by the American Association of University Women reported that 9.6% of students in the United States claim to have received unwanted sexual attention from an adult associated with education; be they a volunteer, bus driver, teacher, administrator or other adult; sometime during their educational career.
320	1369	A study in England showed a 0.3% prevalence of sexual abuse by any professional, a group that included priests, religious leaders, and case workers as well as teachers.
320	1370	It is important to note, however, that the British study referenced above is the only one of its kind and consisted of "a random ... probability sample of 2,869 young people between the ages of 18 and 24 in a computer-assisted study" and that the questions referred to "sexual abuse with a professional," not necessarily a teacher.
320	1371	It is therefore logical to conclude that information on the percentage of abuses by teachers in the United Kingdom is not explicitly available and therefore not necessarily reliable.
320	1372	The AAUW study, however, posed questions about fourteen types of sexual harassment and various degrees of frequency and included only abuses by teachers.
320	1373	"The sample was drawn from a list of 80,000 schools to create a stratified two-stage sample design of 2,065 8th to 11th grade students"Its reliability was gauged at 95% with a 4% margin of error.
321	1374	In the United States especially, several high-profile cases such as Debra LaFave, Pamela Rogers, and Mary Kay Letourneau have caused increased scrutiny on teacher misconduct.
322	1375	Chris Keates, the general secretary of National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said that teachers who have sex with pupils over the age of consent should not be placed on the sex offenders register and that prosecution for statutory rape "is a real anomaly in the law that we are concerned about."
322	1376	This has led to outrage from child protection and parental rights groups.
322	1377	Fears of being labelled a pedophile or hebephile has led to several men who enjoy teaching avoiding the profession.
322	1378	This has in some jurisdictions reportedly led to a shortage of male teachers.
323	1379	Teachers face several occupational hazards in their line of work, including occupational stress, which can negatively impact teachers' mental and physical health, productivity, and students' performance.
323	1380	Stress can be caused by organizational change, relationships with students, fellow teachers, and administrative personnel, working environment, expectations to substitute, long hours with a heavy workload, and inspections.
323	1381	Teachers are also at high risk for occupational burnout.
324	1382	A 2000 study found that 42% of UK teachers experienced occupational stress, twice the figure for the average profession.
324	1383	A 2012 study found that teachers experienced double the rate of anxiety, depression, and stress than average workers.
325	1384	There are several ways to mitigate the occupational hazards of teaching.
325	1385	Organizational interventions, like changing teachers' schedules, providing support networks and mentoring, changing the work environment, and offering promotions and bonuses, may be effective in helping to reduce occupational stress among teachers.
325	1386	Individual-level interventions, including stress-management training and counseling, are also used to relieve occupational stress among teachers.
326	1387	There are many similarities and differences among teachers around the world.
326	1388	In almost all countries teachers are educated in a university or college.
326	1389	Governments may require certification by a recognized body before they can teach in a school.
326	1390	In many countries, elementary school education certificate is earned after completion of high school.
326	1391	The high school student follows an education specialty track, obtain the prerequisite "student-teaching" time, and receive a special diploma to begin teaching after graduation.
326	1392	In addition to certification, many educational institutions especially within the US, require that prospective teachers pass a background check and psychiatric evaluation to be able to teach in classroom.
326	1393	This is not always the case with adult further learning institutions but is fast becoming the norm in many countries as security concerns grow.
327	1394	Education in Australia is primarily the responsibility of the individual states and territories.
327	1395	Generally, education in Australia follows the three-tier model which includes primary education (primary schools), followed by secondary education (secondary schools/high schools) and tertiary education (universities and/or TAFE colleges).
328	1396	Teaching in Canada requires a post-secondary degree Bachelor's Degree.
328	1397	In most provinces a second Bachelor's Degree such as a Bachelor of Education is required to become a qualified teacher.
328	1398	Salary ranges from $40,000/year to $90,000/yr.
328	1399	Teachers have the option to teach for a public school which is funded by the provincial government or teaching in a private school which is funded by the private sector, businesses and sponsors.
329	1400	In Germany, teachers are mainly civil servants recruited in special university classes, called Lehramtstudien (Teaching Education Studies).
329	1401	There are many differences between the teachers for elementary schools (Grundschule), lower secondary schools (Hauptschule), middle level secondary schools (Realschule) and higher level secondary schools (Gymnasium).
329	1402	Salaries for teachers depend on the civil servants' salary index scale (Bundesbesoldungsordnung).
330	1403	Salaries for primary teachers in Ireland depend mainly on seniority (i.e.
330	1404	holding the position of principal, deputy principal or assistant principal), experience and qualifications.
330	1405	Extra pay is also given for teaching through the Irish language, in a Gaeltacht area or on an island.
330	1406	The basic pay for a starting teacher is €27,814 p.a., rising incrementally to €53,423 for a teacher with 25 years service.
330	1407	A principal of a large school with many years experience and several qualifications (M.A., H.Dip., etc.)
331	1408	Teachers are required to be registered with the Teaching Council; under Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, a person employed in any capacity in a recognised teaching post - who is not registered with the Teaching Council - may not be paid from Oireachtas funds.
332	1409	From 2006 Garda vetting has been introduced for new entrants to the teaching profession.
332	1410	These procedures apply to teaching and also to non-teaching posts and those who refuse vetting "cannot be appointed or engaged by the school in any capacity including in a voluntary role".
332	1411	Existing staff will be vetted on a phased basis.
333	1412	Salaries for Nursery, Primary and Secondary School teachers ranged from £20,133 to £41,004 in September 2007, although some salaries can go much higher depending on experience and extra responsibilities.
333	1413	Preschool teachers may earn £20,980 annually.
333	1414	[citation needed] Teachers in state schools must have at least a bachelor's degree, complete an approved teacher education program, and be licensed.
334	1415	Many counties offer alternative licensing programs to attract people into teaching, especially for hard-to-fill positions.
334	1416	Excellent job opportunities are expected as retirements, especially among secondary school teachers, outweigh slowing enrollment growth; opportunities will vary by geographic area and subject taught.
335	1417	In Scotland, anyone wishing to teach must be registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS).
335	1418	Teaching in Scotland is an all graduate profession and the normal route for graduates wishing to teach is to complete a programme of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) at one of the seven Scottish Universities who offer these courses.
335	1419	Once successfully completed, "Provisional Registration" is given by the GTCS which is raised to "Full Registration" status after a year if there is sufficient evidence to show that the "Standard for Full Registration" has been met.
336	1420	For the salary year beginning April 2008, unpromoted teachers in Scotland earned from £20,427 for a Probationer, up to £32,583 after 6 years teaching, but could then go on to earn up to £39,942 as they complete the modules to earn Chartered Teacher Status (requiring at least 6 years at up to two modules per year.)
336	1421	Promotion to Principal Teacher positions attracts a salary of between £34,566 and £44,616; Deputy Head, and Head teachers earn from £40,290 to £78,642.
336	1422	Teachers in Scotland can be registered members of trade unions with the main ones being the Educational Institute of Scotland and the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association.
337	1423	Education in Wales differs in certain respects from education elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
337	1424	For example, a significant number of students all over Wales are educated either wholly or largely through the medium of Welsh: in 2008/09, 22 per cent of classes in maintained primary schools used Welsh as the sole or main medium of instruction.
337	1425	Welsh medium education is available to all age groups through nurseries, schools, colleges and universities and in adult education; lessons in the language itself are compulsory for all pupils until the age of 16.
338	1426	Teachers in Wales can be registered members of trade unions such as ATL, NUT or NASUWT and reports in recent years suggest that the average age of teachers in Wales is falling with teachers being younger than in previous years.
338	1427	A growing cause of concern are that attacks on teachers in Welsh schools which reached an all-time high between 2005 and 2010.
339	1428	In the United States, each state determines the requirements for getting a license to teach in public schools.
339	1429	Teaching certification generally lasts three years, but teachers can receive certificates that last as long as ten years.
339	1430	Public school teachers are required to have a bachelor's degree and the majority must be certified by the state in which they teach.
339	1431	Many charter schools do not require that their teachers be certified, provided they meet the standards to be highly qualified as set by No Child Left Behind.
339	1432	Additionally, the requirements for substitute/temporary teachers are generally not as rigorous as those for full-time professionals.
339	1433	The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there are 1.4 million elementary school teachers, 674,000 middle school teachers, and 1 million secondary school teachers employed in the U.S.
340	1434	In the past, teachers have been paid relatively low salaries.
340	1435	However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years.
340	1436	US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience.
340	1437	Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate.
340	1438	Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught.
340	1439	Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts.
340	1440	The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000.
340	1441	Median salaries for preschool teachers, however, were less than half the national median for secondary teachers, clock in at an estimated $21,000 in 2004.
340	1442	For high school teachers, median salaries in 2007 ranged from $35,000 in South Dakota to $71,000 in New York, with a national median of $52,000.
340	1443	Some contracts may include long-term disability insurance, life insurance, emergency/personal leave and investment options.
340	1444	The American Federation of Teachers' teacher salary survey for the 2006-07 school year found that the average teacher salary was $51,009.
340	1445	In a salary survey report for K-12 teachers, elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary earning $39,259.
340	1446	High school teachers had the highest median salary earning $41,855.
340	1447	Many teachers take advantage of the opportunity to increase their income by supervising after-school programs and other extracurricular activities.
340	1448	In addition to monetary compensation, public school teachers may also enjoy greater benefits (like health insurance) compared to other occupations.
340	1449	Merit pay systems are on the rise for teachers, paying teachers extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations, high test scores and for high success at their overall school.
340	1450	Also, with the advent of the internet, many teachers are now selling their lesson plans to other teachers through the web in order to earn supplemental income, most notably on TeachersPayTeachers.com.
341	1451	There are many forms of spiritual or religious teachers in Christianity, across all three major traditions - (Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational, with a stronger tradition of spiritual formation in the more historic and authoritarian/hierarchical Christian traditions with a long tradition of "discernment of spirits", of vocations, and other aspects of spiritual life, especially the Roman and Orthodox Catholic Churches.
341	1452	In keeping with the individualistic nature of most Protestant denominations, the emphasis on being guided in spiritual development is small, with a heavy emphasis placed on heavy reading and personal, Spirit-enlightened interpretation of the Holy Bible.
342	1453	In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the teacher is an office in the Aaronic priesthood, generally conferred on young boys or recent converts, and has little in common with the "spiritual teacher" archetype.
342	1454	The role of "spiritual teacher" may be filled by many individuals in the LDS Church, often a trusted friend, who may hold any office, from Elder to Bishop, or no office at all.
342	1455	The emphasis on spiritual mentorship in the LDS Church is similar to that in the more "low-church" traditions of Protestantism, with a stronger emphasis placed on the husband and father of a family to provide spiritual guidance for all of his family, ideally in consultation with his wife, even if the husband is not a member of the LDS Church, based on interpretatios of certain Biblical texts which proclaim the spiritual authority of husbands in marriage.
342	1456	Even Priesthood representatives are expected to defer to the father of the house when in his home.
342	1457	Further, additional spiritual guidance is offered by those holding the office of Patriarch, which is supposed by Latter-day Saints to grant certain gifts of the Spirit, such as the ability to prophesy, to its holders.
342	1458	This guidance is generally offered during a ceremony called the patriarchal blessing.
343	1459	In Hinduism the spiritual teacher is known as a guru, and, in many traditions of Hinduism - especially those common in the West - the emphasis on spiritual mentorship is extremely high, with gurus often exercising a great deal of control over the lives of their disciples.
344	1460	In Tibetan Buddhism the teachers of Dharma in Tibet are most commonly called a Lama.
344	1461	A Lama who has through phowa and siddhi consciously determined to be reborn, often many times, in order to continue their Bodhisattva vow is called a Tulku.
345	1462	There are many concepts of teachers in Islam, ranging from mullahs (the teachers at madrassas) to ulemas, who teach of the laws of Islam for the proper way of Islamic living according to the Sunnah and Ahadith, and can render legal verdicts upon matters of Islamic law in accordance with the teaching of one of the Four Schools of Jurisprudence.
345	1463	In the more spiritual or mystical Islamic tradition of Sufism, the position of spiritual teacher and an esoteric (as opposed to exoteric, or actions-oriented, e.g.
345	1464	the Five Pillars of Islam) spirituality and spiritual knowledge takes on a more important dimension, with emphasis on learning from living saints - the highest of which is a Qutb - and of traditions passed down from initiate to initiate, and traceable back to the founder of the order.
346	1465	Martin Luther (/ˈluːθər/ or /ˈluːðər/; German: [ˈmaɐ̯tiːn ˈlʊtɐ] ( listen); 10 November 1483 – 18 February 1546) was a German professor of theology, composer, priest, former monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation.
346	1466	Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Late Medieval Catholic Church.
346	1467	He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money.
346	1468	He proposed an academic discussion of the power and usefulness of indulgences in his Ninety-Five Theses of 1517.
346	1469	His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor.
347	1470	Luther taught that salvation and subsequently eternal life is not earned by good deeds but is received only as a free gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin.
347	1471	His theology challenged the authority and office of the Pope by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge from God and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood.
347	1472	Those who identify with these, and all of Luther's wider teachings, are called Lutherans even though Luther insisted on Christian or Evangelical as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ.
348	1473	His translation of the Bible into the vernacular (instead of Latin) made it more accessible, which had a tremendous impact on the church and German culture.
348	1474	It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language, added several principles to the art of translation, and influenced the writing of an English translation, the Tyndale Bible.
348	1475	His hymns influenced the development of singing in churches.
348	1476	His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage, allowing Protestant clergy to marry.
349	1477	Martin Luther was born to Hans Luder (or Ludher, later Luther) and his wife Margarethe (née Lindemann) on 10 November 1483 in Eisleben, Saxony, then part of the Holy Roman Empire.
349	1478	He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours.
349	1479	His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484, where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council.
349	1480	The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther's mother as a hard-working woman of "trading-class stock and middling means" and notes that Luther's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant.
349	1481	He had several brothers and sisters, and is known to have been close to one of them, Jacob.
349	1482	Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family, and he was determined to see Martin, his eldest son, become a lawyer.
349	1483	He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld, then Magdeburg in 1497, where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life, and Eisenach in 1498.
349	1484	The three schools focused on the so-called "trivium": grammar, rhetoric, and logic.
349	1485	Luther later compared his education there to purgatory and hell.
350	1486	In 1501, at the age of 19, he entered the University of Erfurt, which he later described as a beerhouse and whorehouse.
350	1487	He was made to wake at four every morning for what has been described as "a day of rote learning and often wearying spiritual exercises."
350	1488	He received his master's degree in 1505.
351	1489	In accordance with his father's wishes, Luther enrolled in law school at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately, believing that law represented uncertainty.
351	1490	Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel.
351	1491	He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience.
351	1492	Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important.
351	1493	Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason.
351	1494	For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God.
351	1495	Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation, he believed, and Scripture therefore became increasingly important to him.
352	1496	He later attributed his decision to an event: on 2 July 1505, he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home.
352	1497	During a thunderstorm, a lightning bolt struck near him.
352	1498	Later telling his father he was terrified of death and divine judgment, he cried out, "Help!
352	1499	Saint Anna, I will become a monk!"
352	1500	He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break.
352	1501	He left law school, sold his books, and entered a closed Augustinian cloister in Erfurt on 17 July 1505.
352	1502	One friend blamed the decision on Luther's sadness over the deaths of two friends.
352	1503	Luther himself seemed saddened by the move.
352	1504	Those who attended a farewell supper walked him to the door of the Black Cloister.
352	1505	"This day you see me, and then, not ever again," he said.
352	1506	His father was furious over what he saw as a waste of Luther's education.
353	1507	Luther dedicated himself to the Augustinian order, devoting himself to fasting, long hours in prayer, pilgrimage, and frequent confession.
353	1508	Luther described this period of his life as one of deep spiritual despair.
353	1509	He said, "I lost touch with Christ the Savior and Comforter, and made of him the jailer and hangman of my poor soul."
353	1510	Johann von Staupitz, his superior, pointed Luther's mind away from continual reflection upon his sins toward the merits of Christ.
353	1511	He taught that true repentance does not involve self-inflicted penances and punishments but rather a change of heart.
354	1512	In 1507, he was ordained to the priesthood, and in 1508, von Staupitz, first dean of the newly founded University of Wittenberg, sent for Luther, to teach theology.
354	1513	He received a bachelor's degree in Biblical studies on 9 March 1508, and another bachelor's degree in the Sentences by Peter Lombard in 1509.
355	1514	On 19 October 1512, he was awarded his Doctor of Theology and, on 21 October 1512, was received into the senate of the theological faculty of the University of Wittenberg, having been called to the position of Doctor in Bible.
355	1515	He spent the rest of his career in this position at the University of Wittenberg.
356	1516	In 1516, Johann Tetzel, a Dominican friar and papal commissioner for indulgences, was sent to Germany by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money to rebuild St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
356	1517	Roman Catholic theology stated that faith alone, whether fiduciary or dogmatic, cannot justify man; justification rather depends only on such faith as is active in charity and good works (fides caritate formata).
356	1518	The benefits of good works could be obtained by donating money to the church.
357	1519	On 31 October 1517, Luther wrote to his bishop, Albert of Mainz, protesting the sale of indulgences.
357	1520	He enclosed in his letter a copy of his "Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences", which came to be known as The Ninety-Five Theses.
357	1521	Hans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church, but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices, and the tone of the writing is accordingly "searching, rather than doctrinaire."
357	1522	Hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses, particularly in Thesis 86, which asks: "Why does the pope, whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus, build the basilica of St. Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money?"
358	1523	Luther objected to a saying attributed to Johann Tetzel that "As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory (also attested as 'into heaven') springs."
359	1524	He insisted that, since forgiveness was God's alone to grant, those who claimed that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error.
359	1525	Christians, he said, must not slacken in following Christ on account of such false assurances.
360	1526	However, this oft-quoted saying of Tetzel was by no means representative of contemporary Catholic teaching on indulgences, but rather a reflection of his capacity to exaggerate.
360	1527	Yet if Tetzel overstated the matter in regard to indulgences for the dead, his teaching on indulgences for the living was in line with Catholic dogma of the time.
361	1528	According to scholars Walter Krämer, Götz Trenkler, Gerhard Ritter, and Gerhard Prause, the story of the posting on the door, even though it has settled as one of the pillars of history, has little foundation in truth.
361	1529	The story is based on comments made by Philipp Melanchthon, though it is thought that he was not in Wittenberg at the time.
362	1530	It was not until January 1518 that friends of Luther translated the 95 Theses from Latin into German and printed and widely copied them, making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press.
362	1531	Within two weeks, copies of the theses had spread throughout Germany; within two months, they had spread throughout Europe.
363	1532	Luther's writings circulated widely, reaching France, England, and Italy as early as 1519.
363	1533	Students thronged to Wittenberg to hear Luther speak.
363	1534	He published a short commentary on Galatians and his Work on the Psalms.
363	1535	This early part of Luther's career was one of his most creative and productive.
363	1536	Three of his best-known works were published in 1520: To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church, and On the Freedom of a Christian.
364	1537	From 1510 to 1520, Luther lectured on the Psalms, the books of Hebrews, Romans, and Galatians.
364	1538	As he studied these portions of the Bible, he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Catholic Church in new ways.
364	1539	He became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity.
364	1540	The most important for Luther was the doctrine of justification – God's act of declaring a sinner righteous – by faith alone through God's grace.
364	1541	He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God's grace, attainable only through faith in Jesus as the Messiah.
364	1542	"This one and firm rock, which we call the doctrine of justification," he wrote, "is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine, which comprehends the understanding of all godliness."
365	1543	Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God.
365	1544	This teaching by Luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication On the Bondage of the Will, which was written in response to On Free Will by Desiderius Erasmus (1524).
365	1545	Luther based his position on predestination on St. Paul's epistle to the Ephesians 2:8–10.
365	1546	Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God, Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ, imputed to Christians (rather than infused into them) through faith.
365	1547	"That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law," he wrote.
365	1548	"Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ."
365	1549	Faith, for Luther, was a gift from God; the experience of being justified by faith was "as though I had been born again."
365	1550	His entry into Paradise, no less, was a discovery about "the righteousness of God" – a discovery that "the just person" of whom the Bible speaks (as in Romans 1:17) lives by faith.
365	1551	He explained his concept of "justification" in the Smalcald Articles:
366	1552	Luther's rediscovery of "Christ and His salvation" was the first of two points that became the foundation for the Reformation.
366	1553	His railing against the sale of indulgences was based on it.
367	1554	Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz and Magdeburg did not reply to Luther's letter containing the 95 Theses.
367	1555	He had the theses checked for heresy and in December 1517 forwarded them to Rome.
367	1556	He needed the revenue from the indulgences to pay off a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric.
367	1557	As Luther later noted, "the pope had a finger in the pie as well, because one half was to go to the building of St Peter's Church in Rome".
368	1558	Pope Leo X was used to reformers and heretics, and he responded slowly, "with great care as is proper."
368	1559	Over the next three years he deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against Luther, which served only to harden the reformer's anti-papal theology.
368	1560	First, the Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini drafted a heresy case against Luther, whom Leo then summoned to Rome.
368	1561	The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg, where the Imperial Diet was held.
368	1562	There, in October 1518, under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist.
368	1563	The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy.
368	1564	The hearings degenerated into a shouting match.
368	1565	More than his writing the 95 Theses, Luther's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope.
368	1566	Cajetan's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant, but the legate desisted from doing so.
368	1567	Luther slipped out of the city at night, unbeknownst to Cajetan.
369	1568	In January 1519, at Altenburg in Saxony, the papal nuncio Karl von Miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach.
369	1569	Luther made certain concessions to the Saxon, who was a relative of the Elector, and promised to remain silent if his opponents did.
369	1570	The theologian Johann Eck, however, was determined to expose Luther's doctrine in a public forum.
369	1571	In June and July 1519, he staged a disputation with Luther's colleague Andreas Karlstadt at Leipzig and invited Luther to speak.
369	1572	Luther's boldest assertion in the debate was that Matthew 16:18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture, and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible.
369	1573	For this, Eck branded Luther a new Jan Hus, referring to the Czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415.
369	1574	From that moment, he devoted himself to Luther's defeat.
370	1575	On 15 June 1520, the Pope warned Luther with the papal bull (edict) Exsurge Domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings, including the 95 Theses, within 60 days.
370	1576	That autumn, Johann Eck proclaimed the bull in Meissen and other towns.
370	1577	Karl von Miltitz, a papal nuncio, attempted to broker a solution, but Luther, who had sent the Pope a copy of On the Freedom of a Christian in October, publicly set fire to the bull and decretals at Wittenberg on 10 December 1520, an act he defended in Why the Pope and his Recent Book are Burned and Assertions Concerning All Articles.
370	1578	As a consequence, Luther was excommunicated by Pope Leo X on 3 January 1521, in the bull Decet Romanum Pontificem.
371	1579	The enforcement of the ban on the 95 Theses fell to the secular authorities.
371	1580	On 18 April 1521, Luther appeared as ordered before the Diet of Worms.
371	1581	This was a general assembly of the estates of the Holy Roman Empire that took place in Worms, a town on the Rhine.
371	1582	It was conducted from 28 January to 25 May 1521, with Emperor Charles V presiding.
371	1583	Prince Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, obtained a safe conduct for Luther to and from the meeting.
372	1584	Johann Eck, speaking on behalf of the Empire as assistant of the Archbishop of Trier, presented Luther with copies of his writings laid out on a table and asked him if the books were his, and whether he stood by their contents.
372	1585	Luther confirmed he was their author, but requested time to think about the answer to the second question.
372	1586	He prayed, consulted friends, and gave his response the next day:
373	1587	At the end of this speech, Luther raised his arm "in the traditional salute of a knight winning a bout."
373	1588	Michael Mullett considers this speech as a "world classic of epoch-making oratory."
374	1589	Luther refused to recant his writings.
374	1590	He is sometimes also quoted as saying: "Here I stand.
374	1591	Recent scholars consider the evidence for these words to be unreliable, since they were inserted before "May God help me" only in later versions of the speech and not recorded in witness accounts of the proceedings.
374	1592	However, Mullett suggests that given his nature, "we are free to believe that Luther would tend to select the more dramatic form of words."
375	1593	Over the next five days, private conferences were held to determine Luther's fate.
375	1594	The Emperor presented the final draft of the Edict of Worms on 25 May 1521, declaring Luther an outlaw, banning his literature, and requiring his arrest: "We want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic."
375	1595	It also made it a crime for anyone in Germany to give Luther food or shelter.
375	1596	It permitted anyone to kill Luther without legal consequence.
376	1597	Luther's disappearance during his return trip back to Wittenberg was planned.
376	1598	Frederick III had him intercepted on his way home in the forest near Wittenberg by masked horsemen who were made to appear as armed highwaymen.
376	1599	They escorted Luther to the security of the Wartburg Castle at Eisenach.
376	1600	During his stay at Wartburg, which he referred to as "my Patmos", Luther translated the New Testament from Greek into German and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings.
376	1601	These included a renewed attack on Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz, whom he shamed into halting the sale of indulgences in his episcopates, and a "Refutation of the Argument of Latomus," in which he expounded the principle of justification to Jacobus Latomus, an orthodox theologian from Louvain.
377	1602	In this work, one of his most emphatic statements on faith, he argued that every good work designed to attract God's favor is a sin.
377	1603	All humans are sinners by nature, he explained, and God's grace (which cannot be earned) alone can make them just.
377	1604	On 1 August 1521, Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme: "Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong, but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world.
377	1605	We will commit sins while we are here, for this life is not a place where justice resides."
378	1606	In the summer of 1521, Luther widened his target from individual pieties like indulgences and pilgrimages to doctrines at the heart of Church practices.
378	1607	In On the Abrogation of the Private Mass, he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice, asserting instead that it is a gift, to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation.
378	1608	His essay On Confession, Whether the Pope has the Power to Require It rejected compulsory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution, since "every Christian is a confessor."
378	1609	In November, Luther wrote The Judgement of Martin Luther on Monastic Vows.
378	1610	He assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin, because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation.
379	1611	In 1521 Luther dealt largely with prophecy, in which he broadened the foundations of the Reformation placing them on prophetic faith.
379	1612	His main interest was centered on the prophecy of the Little Horn in Daniel 8:9–12, 23–25.
379	1613	The antichrist of 2 Thessalonians 2 was identified as the power of the Papacy.
379	1614	So too was the Little Horn of Daniel 7, coming up among the divisions of Rome, explicitly applied.
380	1615	Luther made his pronouncements from Wartburg in the context of rapid developments at Wittenberg, of which he was kept fully informed.
380	1616	Andreas Karlstadt, supported by the ex-Augustinian Gabriel Zwilling, embarked on a radical programme of reform there in June 1521, exceeding anything envisaged by Luther.
380	1617	The reforms provoked disturbances, including a revolt by the Augustinian friars against their prior, the smashing of statues and images in churches, and denunciations of the magistracy.
380	1618	After secretly visiting Wittenberg in early December 1521, Luther wrote A Sincere Admonition by Martin Luther to All Christians to Guard Against Insurrection and Rebellion.
380	1619	Wittenberg became even more volatile after Christmas when a band of visionary zealots, the so-called Zwickau prophets, arrived, preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the equality of man, adult baptism, and Christ's imminent return.
380	1620	When the town council asked Luther to return, he decided it was his duty to act.
381	1621	Luther secretly returned to Wittenberg on 6 March 1522.
381	1622	He wrote to the Elector: "During my absence, Satan has entered my sheepfold, and committed ravages which I cannot repair by writing, but only by my personal presence and living word."
381	1623	For eight days in Lent, beginning on Invocavit Sunday, 9 March, Luther preached eight sermons, which became known as the "Invocavit Sermons".
381	1624	In these sermons, he hammered home the primacy of core Christian values such as love, patience, charity, and freedom, and reminded the citizens to trust God's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change.
382	1625	The effect of Luther's intervention was immediate.
382	1626	After the sixth sermon, the Wittenberg jurist Jerome Schurf wrote to the elector: "Oh, what joy has Dr. Martin's return spread among us!
382	1627	His words, through divine mercy, are bringing back every day misguided people into the way of the truth."
383	1628	Luther next set about reversing or modifying the new church practices.
383	1629	By working alongside the authorities to restore public order, he signalled his reinvention as a conservative force within the Reformation.
383	1630	After banishing the Zwickau prophets, he now faced a battle against not only the established Church but also the radical reformers who threatened the new order by fomenting social unrest and violence.
384	1631	Despite his victory in Wittenberg, Luther was unable to stifle radicalism further afield.
384	1632	Preachers such as Zwickau prophet Nicholas Storch and Thomas Müntzer helped instigate the German Peasants' War of 1524–25, during which many atrocities were committed, often in Luther's name.
384	1633	There had been revolts by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century.
384	1634	Luther's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy, often worded with "liberal" phraseology, now led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general.
384	1635	Revolts broke out in Franconia, Swabia, and Thuringia in 1524, even drawing support from disaffected nobles, many of whom were in debt.
384	1636	Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as Müntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol, the revolts turned into war.
385	1637	Luther sympathised with some of the peasants' grievances, as he showed in his response to the Twelve Articles in May 1525, but he reminded the aggrieved to obey the temporal authorities.
385	1638	During a tour of Thuringia, he became enraged at the widespread burning of convents, monasteries, bishops' palaces, and libraries.
385	1639	In Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants, written on his return to Wittenberg, he gave his interpretation of the Gospel teaching on wealth, condemned the violence as the devil's work, and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs:
386	1640	Luther justified his opposition to the rebels on three grounds.
386	1641	First, in choosing violence over lawful submission to the secular government, they were ignoring Christ's counsel to "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's"; St. Paul had written in his epistle to the Romans 13:1–7 that all authorities are appointed by God and therefore should not be resisted.
386	1642	This reference from the Bible forms the foundation for the doctrine known as the Divine Right of Kings, or, in the German case, the divine right of the princes.
386	1643	Second, the violent actions of rebelling, robbing, and plundering placed the peasants "outside the law of God and Empire", so they deserved "death in body and soul, if only as highwaymen and murderers."
386	1644	Lastly, Luther charged the rebels with blasphemy for calling themselves "Christian brethren" and committing their sinful acts under the banner of the Gospel.
387	1645	Without Luther's backing for the uprising, many rebels laid down their weapons; others felt betrayed.
387	1646	Their defeat by the Swabian League at the Battle of Frankenhausen on 15 May 1525, followed by Müntzer's execution, brought the revolutionary stage of the Reformation to a close.
387	1647	Thereafter, radicalism found a refuge in the anabaptist movement and other religious movements, while Luther's Reformation flourished under the wing of the secular powers.
388	1648	Martin Luther married Katharina von Bora, one of 12 nuns he had helped escape from the Nimbschen Cistercian convent in April 1523, when he arranged for them to be smuggled out in herring barrels.
388	1649	"Suddenly, and while I was occupied with far different thoughts," he wrote to Wenceslaus Link, "the Lord has plunged me into marriage."
388	1650	At the time of their marriage, Katharina was 26 years old and Luther was 41 years old.
389	1651	On 13 June 1525, the couple was engaged with Johannes Bugenhagen, Justus Jonas, Johannes Apel, Philipp Melanchthon and Lucas Cranach the Elder and his wife as witnesses.
389	1652	On the evening of the same day, the couple was married by Bugenhagen.
389	1653	The ceremonial walk to the church and the wedding banquet were left out, and were made up two weeks later on 27 June.
390	1654	Some priests and former religious had already married, including Andreas Karlstadt and Justus Jonas, but Luther's wedding set the seal of approval on clerical marriage.
390	1655	He had long condemned vows of celibacy on Biblical grounds, but his decision to marry surprised many, not least Melanchthon, who called it reckless.
390	1656	Luther had written to George Spalatin on 30 November 1524, "I shall never take a wife, as I feel at present.
390	1657	Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex (for I am neither wood nor stone); but my mind is averse to wedlock because I daily expect the death of a heretic."
390	1658	Before marrying, Luther had been living on the plainest food, and, as he admitted himself, his mildewed bed was not properly made for months at a time.
391	1659	Luther and his wife moved into a former monastery, "The Black Cloister," a wedding present from the new elector John the Steadfast (1525–32).
391	1660	They embarked on what appeared to have been a happy and successful marriage, though money was often short.
391	1661	Between bearing six children, Hans – June 1526; Elizabeth – 10 December 1527, who died within a few months; Magdalene – 1529, who died in Luther's arms in 1542; Martin – 1531; Paul – January 1533; and Margaret – 1534; Katharina helped the couple earn a living by farming the land and taking in boarders.
391	1662	Luther confided to Michael Stiefel on 11 August 1526: "My Katie is in all things so obliging and pleasing to me that I would not exchange my poverty for the riches of Croesus."
392	1663	By 1526, Luther found himself increasingly occupied in organising a new church.
392	1664	His Biblical ideal of congregations' choosing their own ministers had proved unworkable.
392	1665	According to Bainton: "Luther's dilemma was that he wanted both a confessional church based on personal faith and experience and a territorial church including all in a given locality.
392	1666	If he were forced to choose, he would take his stand with the masses, and this was the direction in which he moved."
392	1667	From 1525 to 1529, he established a supervisory church body, laid down a new form of worship service, and wrote a clear summary of the new faith in the form of two catechisms.
392	1668	Luther's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a theology of the cross, the negation of every affirmation: as long as the cross is at the center, the system building tendency of reason is held in check, and system building does not degenerate into System.
393	1669	To avoid confusing or upsetting the people, Luther avoided extreme change.
393	1670	He also did not wish to replace one controlling system with another.
393	1671	He concentrated on the church in the Electorate of Saxony, acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories, many of which followed his Saxon model.
393	1672	He worked closely with the new elector, John the Steadfast, to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with Rome.
393	1673	For Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, this partnership "was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign".
393	1674	The elector authorised a visitation of the church, a power formerly exercised by bishops.
393	1675	At times, Luther's practical reforms fell short of his earlier radical pronouncements.
393	1676	For example, the Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony (1528), drafted by Melanchthon with Luther's approval, stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins, despite Luther's position that faith alone ensures justification.
393	1677	The Eisleben reformer Johannes Agricola challenged this compromise, and Luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works.
393	1678	The Instruction is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luther's thought and practice.
394	1679	In response to demands for a German liturgy, Luther wrote a German Mass, which he published in early 1526.
394	1680	He did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass but as an alternative for the "simple people", a "public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians."
394	1681	Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted "everything that smacks of sacrifice"; and the Mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread.
394	1682	He retained the elevation of the host and chalice, while trappings such as the Mass vestments, altar, and candles were made optional, allowing freedom of ceremony.
394	1683	Some reformers, including followers of Huldrych Zwingli, considered Luther's service too papistic; and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic mass.
394	1684	Luther's service, however, included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German, as well as of parts of the liturgy, including Luther's unison setting of the Creed.
394	1685	To reach the simple people and the young, Luther incorporated religious instruction into the weekday services in the form of the catechism.
394	1686	He also provided simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services.
395	1687	Luther and his colleagues introduced the new order of worship during their visitation of the Electorate of Saxony, which began in 1527.
395	1688	They also assessed the standard of pastoral care and Christian education in the territory.
395	1689	"Merciful God, what misery I have seen," Luther wrote, "the common people knowing nothing at all of Christian doctrine ... and unfortunately many pastors are well-nigh unskilled and incapable of teaching."
396	1690	Luther devised the catechism as a method of imparting the basics of Christianity to the congregations.
396	1691	In 1529, he wrote the Large Catechism, a manual for pastors and teachers, as well as a synopsis, the Small Catechism, to be memorised by the people themselves.
396	1692	The catechisms provided easy-to-understand instructional and devotional material on the Ten Commandments, the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, baptism, and the Lord's Supper.
396	1693	Luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of Christian faith would not just be learned by rote, "the way monkeys do it", but understood.
397	1694	The catechism is one of Luther's most personal works.
397	1695	"Regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes," he wrote, "I am quite cool and not at all eager about it because, roused by a Saturnian hunger, I would rather see them all devoured.
397	1696	For I acknowledge none of them to be really a book of mine, except perhaps the Bondage of the Will and the Catechism."
397	1697	The Small Catechism has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching.
397	1698	It remains in use today, along with Luther's hymns and his translation of the Bible.
398	1699	Luther's Small Catechism proved especially effective in helping parents teach their children; likewise the Larger Catechism was effective for pastors.
398	1700	Using the German vernacular, they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language.
398	1701	He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit.
398	1702	Luther's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity, each of which works in the catechumen's life.
398	1703	That is, Luther depicted the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned, but as persons to be known.
398	1704	The Father creates, the Son redeems, and the Spirit sanctifies, a divine unity with separate personalities.
398	1705	Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father.
398	1706	Luther's treatment of the Apostles' Creed must be understood in the context of the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments) and the Lord's Prayer, which are also part of the Lutheran catechical teaching.
399	1707	Luther had published his German translation of the New Testament in 1522, and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the Old Testament in 1534, when the whole Bible was published.
399	1708	He continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life.
399	1709	Others had translated the Bible into German, but Luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine.
399	1710	When he was criticised for inserting the word "alone" after "faith" in Romans 3:28, he replied in part: "[T]he text itself and the meaning of St. Paul urgently require and demand it.
399	1711	For in that very passage he is dealing with the main point of Christian doctrine, namely, that we are justified by faith in Christ without any works of the Law.
399	1712	But when works are so completely cut away – and that must mean that faith alone justifies – whoever would speak plainly and clearly about this cutting away of works will have to say, 'Faith alone justifies us, and not works'."
400	1713	Luther's translation used the variant of German spoken at the Saxon chancellery, intelligible to both northern and southern Germans.
400	1714	He intended his vigorous, direct language to make the Bible accessible to everyday Germans, "for we are removing impediments and difficulties so that other people may read it without hindrance."
401	1715	Published at a time of rising demand for German-language publications, Luther's version quickly became a popular and influential Bible translation.
401	1716	As such, it made a significant contribution to the evolution of the German language and literature.
401	1717	Furnished with notes and prefaces by Luther, and with woodcuts by Lucas Cranach that contained anti-papal imagery, it played a major role in the spread of Luther's doctrine throughout Germany.
401	1718	The Luther Bible influenced other vernacular translations, such as William Tyndale's English Bible (1525 forward), a precursor of the King James Bible.
402	1719	Luther was a prolific hymn-writer, authoring hymns such as "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott" ("A Mighty Fortress Is Our God"), based on Psalm 46, and "Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her" ("From Heaven Above to Earth I Come"), based on Luke 2:11–12.
402	1720	Luther connected high art and folk music, also all classes, clergy and laity, men, women and children.
402	1721	His tool of choice for this connection was the singing of German hymns in connection with worship, school, home, and the public arena.
402	1722	He often accompanied the sung hymns with a lute, later recreated as the waldzither that became a national instrument of Germany in the 20th century.
403	1723	Luther's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation.
403	1724	This behavior started with his learning of the execution of Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes, the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views, prompting Luther to write the hymn "Ein neues Lied wir heben an" ("A new song we raise"), which is generally known in English by John C. Messenger's translation by the title and first line "Flung to the Heedless Winds" and sung to the tune Ibstone composed in 1875 by Maria C. Tiddeman.
404	1725	Luther's 1524 creedal hymn "Wir glauben all an einen Gott" ("We All Believe in One True God") is a three-stanza confession of faith prefiguring Luther's 1529 three-part explanation of the Apostles' Creed in the Small Catechism.
404	1726	Luther's hymn, adapted and expanded from an earlier German creedal hymn, gained widespread use in vernacular Lutheran liturgies as early as 1525.
404	1727	Sixteenth-century Lutheran hymnals also included "Wir glauben all" among the catechetical hymns, although 18th-century hymnals tended to label the hymn as Trinitarian rather than catechetical, and 20th-century Lutherans rarely use the hymn because of the perceived difficulty of its tune.
405	1728	Luther's 1538 hymnic version of the Lord's Prayer, "Vater unser im Himmelreich", corresponds exactly to Luther's explanation of the prayer in the Small Catechism, with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions, plus opening and closing stanzas.
405	1729	The hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the Lord's Prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions.
405	1730	The extant manuscript shows multiple revisions, demonstrating Luther's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune.
405	1731	Other 16th- and 20th-century versifications of the Lord's Prayer have adopted Luther's tune, although modern texts are considerably shorter.
406	1732	Luther wrote "Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir" ("From depths of woe I cry to you") in 1523 as a hymnic version of Psalm 130 and sent it as a sample to encourage evangelical colleagues to write psalm-hymns for use in German worship.
406	1733	In a collaboration with Paul Speratus, this and seven other hymns were published in the Achtliederbuch, the first Lutheran hymnal.
406	1734	In 1524 Luther developed his original four-stanza psalm paraphrase into a five-stanza Reformation hymn that developed the theme of "grace alone" more fully.
406	1735	Because it expressed essential Reformation doctrine, this expanded version of "Aus tiefer Not" was designated as a regular component of several regional Lutheran liturgies and was widely used at funerals, including Luther's own.
406	1736	Along with Erhart Hegenwalt's hymnic version of Psalm 51, Luther's expanded hymn was also adopted for use with the fifth part of Luther's catechism, concerning confession.
407	1737	Luther wrote "Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein" ("Oh God, look down from heaven").
407	1738	"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland" (Now come, Savior of the gentiles), based on Veni redemptor gentium, became the main hymn (Hauptlied) for Advent.
407	1739	He transformed A solus ortus cardine to "Christum wir sollen loben schon" ("We should now praise Christ") and Veni Creator Spiritus to "Komm, Gott Schöpfer, Heiliger Geist" ("Come, Holy Spirit, Lord God").
407	1740	He wrote two hymns on the Ten Commandments, "Dies sind die heilgen Zehn Gebot" and "Mensch, willst du leben seliglich".
407	1741	His "Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ" ("Praise be to You, Jesus Christ") became the main hymn for Christmas.
407	1742	He wrote for Pentecost "Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist", and adopted for Easter "Christ ist erstanden" (Christ is risen), based on Victimae paschali laudes.
407	1743	"Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin", a paraphrase of Nunc dimittis, was intended for Purification, but became also a funeral hymn.
407	1744	He paraphrased the Te Deum as "Herr Gott, dich loben wir" with a simplified form of the melody.
407	1745	It became known as the German Te Deum.
408	1746	Luther's 1541 hymn "Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam" ("To Jordan came the Christ our Lord") reflects the structure and substance of his questions and answers concerning baptism in the Small Catechism.
408	1747	Luther adopted a preexisting Johann Walter tune associated with a hymnic setting of Psalm 67's prayer for grace; Wolf Heintz's four-part setting of the hymn was used to introduce the Lutheran Reformation in Halle in 1541.
408	1748	Preachers and composers of the 18th century, including J. S. Bach, used this rich hymn as a subject for their own work, although its objective baptismal theology was displaced by more subjective hymns under the influence of late-19th-century Lutheran pietism.
409	1749	Luther's hymns were included in early Lutheran hymnals and spread the ideas of the Reformation.
409	1750	He supplied four of eight songs of the First Lutheran hymnal Achtliederbuch, 18 of 26 songs of the Erfurt Enchiridion, and 24 of the 32 songs in the first choral hymnal with settings by Johann Walter, Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn, all published in 1524.
410	1751	Luther's hymns inspired composers to write music.
411	1752	In contrast to the views of John Calvin and Philipp Melanchthon, throughout his life Luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a Christian's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death; and, accordingly, he disputed traditional interpretations of some Bible passages, such as the parable of the rich man and Lazarus.
411	1753	This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints: "It is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell, but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace."
411	1754	He also rejected the existence of Purgatory, which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death.
411	1755	He affirmed the continuity of one's personal identity beyond death.
411	1756	In his Smalcald Articles, he described the saints as currently residing "in their graves and in heaven."
412	1757	The Lutheran theologian Franz Pieper observed that Luther's teaching about the state of the Christian's soul after death differed from the later Lutheran theologians such as Johann Gerhard.
412	1758	Lessing (1755) had earlier reached the same conclusion in his analysis of Lutheran orthodoxy on this issue.
413	1759	Luther's Commentary on Genesis contains a passage which concludes that "the soul does not sleep (anima non sic dormit), but wakes (sed vigilat) and experiences visions".
413	1760	Francis Blackburne in 1765 argued that John Jortin misread this and other passages from Luther, while Gottfried Fritschel pointed out in 1867 that it actually refers to the soul of a man "in this life" (homo enim in hac vita) tired from his daily labour (defatigus diurno labore) who at night enters his bedchamber (sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum) and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams.
414	1761	In October 1529, Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, convoked an assembly of German and Swiss theologians at the Marburg Colloquy, to establish doctrinal unity in the emerging Protestant states.
414	1762	Agreement was achieved on fourteen points out of fifteen, the exception being the nature of the Eucharist – the sacrament of the Lord's Supper—an issue crucial to Luther.
415	1763	The theologians, including Zwingli, Melanchthon, Martin Bucer, and Johannes Oecolampadius, differed on the significance of the words spoken by Jesus at the Last Supper: "This is my body which is for you" and "This cup is the new covenant in my blood" (1 Corinthians 11:23–26).
415	1764	Luther insisted on the Real Presence of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine, which he called the sacramental union, while his opponents believed God to be only spiritually or symbolically present.
415	1765	Zwingli, for example, denied Jesus' ability to be in more than one place at a time but Luther stressed the omnipresence of his human nature.
415	1766	According to transcripts, the debate sometimes became confrontational.
415	1767	Citing Jesus' words "The flesh profiteth nothing" (John 6.63), Zwingli said, "This passage breaks your neck".
415	1768	"Don't be too proud," Luther retorted, "German necks don't break that easily.
415	1769	On his table Luther wrote the words "Hoc est corpus meum" ("This is my body") in chalk, to continually indicate his firm stance.
416	1770	Despite the disagreements on the Eucharist, the Marburg Colloquy paved the way for the signing in 1530 of the Augsburg Confession, and for the formation of the Schmalkaldic League the following year by leading Protestant nobles such as John of Saxony, Philip of Hesse, and George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach.
416	1771	The Swiss cities, however, did not sign these agreements.
417	1772	Some scholars have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason.
417	1773	He wrote, "All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false."
417	1774	and "[That] Reason in no way contributes to faith.
417	1775	[...] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things."
417	1776	However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason "strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it", bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute.
417	1777	Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther.
417	1778	Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to.
417	1779	Bernhard Lohse, for example, has demonstrated in his classic work "Fides und Ratio" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together.
417	1780	More recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method.
417	1781	This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence.
417	1782	The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation.
417	1783	Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership.
417	1784	Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres.
418	1785	In 1523, Luther wrote that Jesus Christ was born a Jew which discouraged mistreatment of the Jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the Old Testament could be shown to speak of Jesus Christ.
418	1786	However, as the Reformation continued, Luther began to lose hope in large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity.
418	1787	In his later years, Luther grew more hostile toward the Jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists, Zwinglianism, and the papacy.
418	1788	His 1543 treatise Von den Juden und ihren Lügen (On the Jews and Their Lies) took its place among other anti-Jewish literature of the times, although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme, even by the standards of sixteenth century Europe.
418	1789	In it, he takes a hardline against Judaism, writing that synagogues and Jewish homes should be destroyed, their money confiscated, and liberty curtailed.
418	1790	These statements and their influence on antisemitism have contributed to his controversial status.
419	1791	At the time of the Marburg Colloquy, Suleiman the Magnificent was besieging Vienna with a vast Ottoman army.
419	1792	Luther had argued against resisting the Turks in his 1518 Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses, provoking accusations of defeatism.
419	1793	He saw the Turks as a scourge sent to punish Christians by God, as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist, whom Luther believed to be the papacy, and the Roman Church.
419	1794	He consistently rejected the idea of a Holy War, "as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks, who were enemies of Christ.
419	1795	This is absolutely contrary to Christ's doctrine and name".
419	1796	On the other hand, in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms, Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks.
419	1797	In 1526, he argued in Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace that national defence is reason for a just war.
419	1798	By 1529, in On War against the Turk, he was actively urging Emperor Charles V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks.
419	1799	He made clear, however, that the spiritual war against an alien faith was separate, to be waged through prayer and repentance.
419	1800	Around the time of the Siege of Vienna, Luther wrote a prayer for national deliverance from the Turks, asking God to "give to our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies".
420	1801	In 1542, Luther read a Latin translation of the Qur'an.
420	1802	He went on to produce several critical pamphlets on Islam, which he called "Mohammedanism" or "the Turk".
420	1803	Though Luther saw the Muslim faith as a tool of the devil, he was indifferent to its practice: "Let the Turk believe and live as he will, just as one lets the papacy and other false Christians live."
420	1804	He opposed banning the publication of the Qur'an, wanting it exposed to scrutiny.
421	1805	Early in 1537, Johannes Agricola (1494–1566) – serving at the time as pastor in Luther's birthplace, Eisleben – preached a sermon in which he claimed that God's gospel, not God's moral law (the Ten Commandments), revealed God's wrath to Christians.
421	1806	Based on this sermon and others by Agricola, Luther suspected that Agricola was behind certain anonymous antinomian theses circulating in Wittenberg.
421	1807	These theses asserted that the law is no longer to be taught to Christians but belonged only to city hall.
421	1808	Luther responded to these theses with six series of theses against Agricola and the antinomians, four of which became the basis for disputations between 1538 and 1540.
421	1809	He also responded to these assertions in other writings, such as his 1539 open letter to C. Güttel Against the Antinomians, and his book On the Councils and the Church from the same year.
422	1810	In his theses and disputations against the antinomians, Luther reviews and reaffirms, on the one hand, what has been called the "second use of the law," that is, the law as the Holy Spirit's tool to work sorrow over sin in man's heart, thus preparing him for Christ's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel.
422	1811	Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law, even if it is Christ's life, Christ's death for sin, or God's goodness experienced in creation.
422	1812	Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby, as it were, removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law.
422	1813	Claiming that the law – in any form – should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people.
423	1814	On the other hand, Luther also points out that the Ten Commandments – when considered not as God's condemning judgment but as an expression of his eternal will, that is, of the natural law – also positively teach how the Christian ought to live.
423	1815	This has traditionally been called the "third use of the law."
423	1816	For Luther, also Christ's life, when understood as an example, is nothing more than an illustration of the Ten Commandments, which a Christian should follow in his or her vocations on a daily basis.
424	1817	The Ten Commandments, and the beginnings of the renewed life of Christians accorded to them by the sacrament of baptism, are a present foreshadowing of the believers' future angel-like life in heaven in the midst of this life.
424	1818	Luther's teaching of the Ten Commandments, therefore, has clear eschatological overtones, which, characteristically for Luther, do not encourage world-flight but direct the Christian to service to the neighbor in the common, daily vocations of this perishing world.
425	1819	From December 1539, Luther became implicated in the bigamy of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, who wanted to marry one of his wife's ladies-in-waiting.
425	1820	Philip solicited the approval of Luther, Melanchthon, and Bucer, citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs.
425	1821	The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling, and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined, he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter.
425	1822	As a result, on 4 March 1540, Philip married a second wife, Margarethe von der Saale, with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses.
425	1823	However, Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret, and he threatened to make Luther's advice public.
425	1824	Luther told him to "tell a good, strong lie" and deny the marriage completely, which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy.
425	1825	In the view of Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, "giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made, and, next to the landgrave himself, who was directly responsible for it, history chiefly holds Luther accountable".
425	1826	Brecht argues that Luther's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice, but that he miscalculated the political implications.
425	1827	The affair caused lasting damage to Luther's reputation.
426	1828	Luther wrote about the Jews throughout his career, though only a few of his works dealt with them directly.
426	1829	Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life, but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ, and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier.
426	1830	He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus, whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah.
426	1831	But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty.
426	1832	As early as 1516, he wrote that many people "are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs, evildoers, or whatever they like, while they too, and equally, do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God".
426	1833	In 1523, Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity.
426	1834	When his efforts at conversion failed, he grew increasingly bitter toward them.
426	1835	In his 2010 book Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy, Christian author Eric Metaxas claimed that Luther's attitude towards Jews "unraveled along with his health."
427	1836	Luther's other major works on the Jews were his 60,000-word treatise Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen (On the Jews and Their Lies), and Vom Schem Hamphoras und vom Geschlecht Christi (On the Holy Name and the Lineage of Christ), both published in 1543, three years before his death.
427	1837	Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but "the devil's people", and referred to them with violent, vile language.
427	1838	Citing Deuteronomy 13, wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God, Luther called for a "scharfe Barmherzigkeit" ("sharp mercy") against the Jews "to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames."
427	1839	Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire, destroying Jewish prayerbooks, forbidding rabbis from preaching, seizing Jews' property and money, and smashing up their homes, so that these "envenomed worms" would be forced into labour or expelled "for all time".
427	1840	In Robert Michael's view, Luther's words "We are at fault in not slaying them" amounted to a sanction for murder.
427	1841	"God's anger with them is so intense," Luther concluded, "that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse, while sharp mercy will reform them but little.
427	1842	Therefore, in any case, away with them!"
428	1843	Luther spoke out against the Jews in Saxony, Brandenburg, and Silesia.
428	1844	Josel of Rosheim, the Jewish spokesman who tried to help the Jews of Saxony in 1537, later blamed their plight on "that priest whose name was Martin Luther—may his body and soul be bound up in hell!—who wrote and issued many heretical books in which he said that whoever would help the Jews was doomed to perdition."
428	1845	Josel asked the city of Strasbourg to forbid the sale of Luther's anti-Jewish works: they refused initially, but did so when a Lutheran pastor in Hochfelden used a sermon to urge his parishioners to murder Jews.
428	1846	Luther's influence persisted after his death.
428	1847	Throughout the 1580s, riots led to the expulsion of Jews from several German Lutheran states.
429	1848	Luther was the most widely read author of his generation, and within Germany he acquired the status of a prophet.
429	1849	According to the prevailing view among historians, his anti-Jewish rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in Germany, and in the 1930s and 1940s provided an "ideal underpinning" for the Nazis' attacks on Jews.
429	1850	Reinhold Lewin writes that anybody who "wrote against the Jews for whatever reason believed he had the right to justify himself by triumphantly referring to Luther."
429	1851	According to Michael, just about every anti-Jewish book printed in the Third Reich contained references to and quotations from Luther.
429	1852	Heinrich Himmler wrote admiringly of his writings and sermons on the Jews in 1940.
429	1853	The city of Nuremberg presented a first edition of On the Jews and their Lies to Julius Streicher, editor of the Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer, on his birthday in 1937; the newspaper described it as the most radically anti-Semitic tract ever published.
429	1854	It was publicly exhibited in a glass case at the Nuremberg rallies and quoted in a 54-page explanation of the Aryan Law by Dr. E.H. Schulz and Dr. R. Frercks.
430	1855	On 17 December 1941, seven Protestant regional church confederations issued a statement agreeing with the policy of forcing Jews to wear the yellow badge, "since after his bitter experience Luther had already suggested preventive measures against the Jews and their expulsion from German territory."
430	1856	According to Daniel Goldhagen, Bishop Martin Sasse, a leading Protestant churchman, published a compendium of Luther's writings shortly after Kristallnacht, for which Diarmaid MacCulloch, Professor of the History of the Church in the University of Oxford argued that Luther's writing was a "blueprint."
430	1857	Sasse applauded the burning of the synagogues and the coincidence of the day, writing in the introduction, "On 10 November 1938, on Luther's birthday, the synagogues are burning in Germany."
430	1858	The German people, he urged, ought to heed these words "of the greatest antisemite of his time, the warner of his people against the Jews."
431	1859	At the heart of scholars' debate about Luther's influence is whether it is anachronistic to view his work as a precursor of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis.
431	1860	Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic.
431	1861	Biographer Martin Brecht points out that "There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology.
431	1862	Nevertheless, his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews, cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer."
431	1863	Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology.
431	1864	Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work.
431	1865	Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history.
431	1866	Similarly, Roland Bainton, noted church historian and Luther biographer, wrote "One could wish that Luther had died before ever [On the Jews and Their Lies] was written.
431	1867	His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial."
432	1868	Other scholars argue that, even if his views were merely anti-Judaic—that is, opposed to Judaism and its adherence rather than the Jews as an ethnic group—their violence lent a new element to the standard Christian suspicion of Judaism.
432	1869	Ronald Berger writes that Luther is credited with "Germanizing the Christian critique of Judaism and establishing anti-Semitism as a key element of German culture and national identity."
432	1870	Paul Rose argues that he caused a "hysterical and demonizing mentality" about Jews to enter German thought and discourse, a mentality that might otherwise have been absent.
432	1871	Christopher J. Probst in his book Demonizing the Jews: Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany (2012), shows that a large number of German Lutheran clergy and theologians during the Nazi Third Reich used Luther's hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion to justify at least in part the anti-Semitic policies of the National Socialists.
433	1872	Some scholars, such as Mark U. Edwards in his book Luther's Last Battles: Politics and Polemics 1531–46 (1983), suggest that since Luther's increasingly antisemitic views developed during the years his health deteriorated, it is possible they were at least partly the product of a declining state of mind.
433	1873	Edwards also comments that Luther often deliberately used "vulgarity and violence" for effect, both in his writings condemning the Jews and in diatribes against "Turks" (Muslims) and Catholics.
434	1874	Since the 1980s, Lutheran Church denominations have repudiated Martin Luther's statements against the Jews and have rejected the use of them to incite hatred against Lutherans.
434	1875	's 1970 survey of 4,745 North American Lutherans aged 15–65 found that, compared to the other minority groups under consideration, Lutherans were the least prejudiced toward Jews.
434	1876	Nevertheless, Professor Richard (Dick) Geary, former Professor of Modern History at the University of Nottingham, England, and the author of Hitler and Nazism (Routledge 1993), wrote in the journal History Today an article on who voted for the Nazis in elections held from 1928-1933, where he claimed that from his research he found that the Nazis gained disproportionately more votes from Protestant than Catholic areas of Germany.
435	1877	Luther had been suffering from ill health for years, including Ménière's disease, vertigo, fainting, tinnitus, and a cataract in one eye.
435	1878	From 1531 to 1546, his health deteriorated further.
435	1879	The years of struggle with Rome, the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers, and the scandal which ensued from the bigamy of the Philip of Hesse incident, in which Luther had played a leading role, all may have contributed.
435	1880	In 1536, he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones, and arthritis, and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum.
435	1881	In December 1544, he began to feel the effects of angina.
436	1882	His poor physical health made him short-tempered and even harsher in his writings and comments.
436	1883	His wife Katharina was overheard saying, "Dear husband, you are too rude," and he responded, "They are teaching me to be rude."
436	1884	In 1545 and 1546 Luther preached three times in the Market Church in Halle, staying with his friend Justus Jonas during Christmas.
437	1885	His last sermon was delivered at Eisleben, his place of birth, on 15 February 1546, three days before his death.
437	1886	It was "entirely devoted to the obdurate Jews, whom it was a matter of great urgency to expel from all German territory," according to Léon Poliakov.
437	1887	James Mackinnon writes that it concluded with a "fiery summons to drive the Jews bag and baggage from their midst, unless they desisted from their calumny and their usury and became Christians."
437	1888	Luther said, "we want to practice Christian love toward them and pray that they convert," but also that they are "our public enemies ... and if they could kill us all, they would gladly do so.
438	1889	Luther's final journey, to Mansfeld, was taken because of his concern for his siblings' families continuing in their father Hans Luther's copper mining trade.
438	1890	Their livelihood was threatened by Count Albrecht of Mansfeld bringing the industry under his own control.
438	1891	The controversy that ensued involved all four Mansfeld counts: Albrecht, Philip, John George, and Gerhard.
438	1892	Luther journeyed to Mansfeld twice in late 1545 to participate in the negotiations for a settlement, and a third visit was needed in early 1546 for their completion.
439	1893	The negotiations were successfully concluded on 17 February 1546.
439	1894	After 8 a.m., he experienced chest pains.
439	1895	When he went to his bed, he prayed, "Into your hand I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O Lord, faithful God" (Ps.
439	1896	31:5), the common prayer of the dying.
439	1897	At 1 a.m. he awoke with more chest pain and was warmed with hot towels.
439	1898	He thanked God for revealing his Son to him in whom he had believed.
439	1899	His companions, Justus Jonas and Michael Coelius, shouted loudly, "Reverend father, are you ready to die trusting in your Lord Jesus Christ and to confess the doctrine which you have taught in his name?"
439	1900	A distinct "Yes" was Luther's reply.
440	1901	An apoplectic stroke deprived him of his speech, and he died shortly afterwards at 2:45 a.m. on 18 February 1546, aged 62, in Eisleben, the city of his birth.
440	1902	He was buried in the Castle Church in Wittenberg, beneath the pulpit.
440	1903	The funeral was held by his friends Johannes Bugenhagen and Philipp Melanchthon.
440	1904	A year later, troops of Luther's adversary Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor entered the town, but were ordered by Charles not to disturb the grave.
441	1905	A piece of paper was later found on which Luther had written his last statement.
441	1906	The statement was in Latin, apart from "We are beggars," which was in German.
442	1907	In the 1530s and 1540s, printed images of Luther that emphasized his monumental size were crucial to the spread of Protestantism.
442	1908	In contrast to images of frail Catholic saints, Luther was presented as a stout man with a "double chin, strong mouth, piercing deep-set eyes, fleshy face, and squat neck."
442	1909	He was shown to be physically imposing, an equal in stature to the secular German princes with whom he would join forces to spread Lutheranism.
442	1910	His large body also let the viewer know that he did not shun earthly pleasures like drinking—behavior that was a stark contrast to the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders.
442	1911	Famous images from this period include the woodcuts by Hans Brosamer (1530) and Lucas Cranach the Elder and Lucas Cranach the Younger (1546).
443	1912	Luther is honoured on 18 February with a commemoration in the Lutheran Calendar of Saints and in the Episcopal (United States) Calendar of Saints.
443	1913	In the Church of England's Calendar of Saints he is commemorated on 31 October.
444	1914	Southern California, often abbreviated SoCal, is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises California's southernmost 10 counties.
444	1915	The region is traditionally described as "eight counties", based on demographics and economic ties: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura.
444	1916	The more extensive 10-county definition, including Kern and San Luis Obispo counties, is also used based on historical political divisions.
444	1917	Southern California is a major economic center for the state of California and the United States.
445	1918	The 8- and 10-county definitions are not used for the greater Southern California Megaregion, one of the 11 megaregions of the United States.
445	1919	The megaregion's area is more expansive, extending east into Las Vegas, Nevada, and south across the Mexican border into Tijuana.
446	1920	Southern California includes the heavily built-up urban area stretching along the Pacific coast from Ventura, through the Greater Los Angeles Area and the Inland Empire, and down to Greater San Diego.
446	1921	Southern California's population encompasses seven metropolitan areas, or MSAs: the Los Angeles metropolitan area, consisting of Los Angeles and Orange counties; the Inland Empire, consisting of Riverside and San Bernardino counties; the San Diego metropolitan area; the Oxnard–Thousand Oaks–Ventura metropolitan area; the Santa Barbara metro area; the San Luis Obispo metropolitan area; and the El Centro area.
446	1922	Out of these, three are heavy populated areas: the Los Angeles area with over 12 million inhabitants, the Riverside-San Bernardino area with over four million inhabitants, and the San Diego area with over 3 million inhabitants.
446	1923	For CSA metropolitan purposes, the five counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura are all combined to make up the Greater Los Angeles Area with over 17.5 million people.
446	1924	With over 22 million people, southern California contains roughly 60 percent of California's population.
447	1925	To the east is the Colorado Desert and the Colorado River at the border with Arizona, and the Mojave Desert at the border with the state of Nevada.
447	1926	To the south is the Mexico–United States border.
448	1927	Within southern California are two major cities, Los Angeles and San Diego, as well as three of the country's largest metropolitan areas.
448	1928	With a population of 3,792,621, Los Angeles is the most populous city in California and the second most populous in the United States.
448	1929	To the south and with a population of 1,307,402 is San Diego, the second most populous city in the state and the eighth most populous in the nation.
449	1930	Its counties of Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, San Bernardino, and Riverside are the five most populous in the state and all are in the top 15 most populous counties in the United States.
450	1931	The motion picture, television, and music industry is centered on the Los Angeles in southern California.
450	1932	Hollywood, a district within Los Angeles, is also a name associated with the motion picture industry.
450	1933	Headquartered in southern California are The Walt Disney Company (which also owns ABC), Sony Pictures, Universal, MGM, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and Warner Brothers.
450	1934	Universal, Warner Brothers, and Sony also run major record companies as well.
451	1935	Southern California is also home to a large home grown surf and skateboard culture.
451	1936	Companies such as Volcom, Quiksilver, No Fear, RVCA, and Body Glove are all headquartered here.
451	1937	Professional skateboarder Tony Hawk, professional surfers Rob Machado, Tim Curran, Bobby Martinez, Pat O'Connell, Dane Reynolds, and Chris Ward, and professional snowboarder Shaun White live in southern California.
451	1938	Some of the world's legendary surf spots are in southern California as well, including Trestles, Rincon, The Wedge, Huntington Beach, and Malibu, and it is second only to the island of Oahu in terms of famous surf breaks.
451	1939	Some of the world's biggest extreme sports events, including the X Games, Boost Mobile Pro, and the U.S. Open of Surfing are all in southern California.
451	1940	Southern California is also important to the world of yachting.
451	1941	The annual Transpacific Yacht Race, or Transpac, from Los Angeles to Hawaii, is one of yachting's premier events.
451	1942	The San Diego Yacht Club held the America's Cup, the most prestigious prize in yachting, from 1988 to 1995 and hosted three America's Cup races during that time.
452	1943	Many locals and tourists frequent the southern California coast for its popular beaches, and the desert city of Palm Springs is popular for its resort feel and nearby open spaces.
453	1944	"Southern California" is not a formal geographic designation, and definitions of what constitutes southern California vary.
453	1945	Geographically, California's north-south midway point lies at exactly 37° 9' 58.23" latitude, around 11 miles (18 km) south of San Jose; however, this does not coincide with popular use of the term.
453	1946	When the state is divided into two areas (northern and southern California), the term "southern California" usually refers to the ten southern-most counties of the state.
453	1947	This definition coincides neatly with the county lines at 35° 47′ 28″ north latitude, which form the northern borders of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernardino counties.
453	1948	Another definition for southern California uses Point Conception and the Tehachapi Mountains as the northern boundary.
454	1949	Though there is no official definition for the northern boundary of southern California, such a division has existed from the time when Mexico ruled California, and political disputes raged between the Californios of Monterey in the upper part and Los Angeles in the lower part of Alta California.
454	1950	Following the acquisition of California by the United States, the division continued as part of the attempt by several pro-slavery politicians to arrange the division of Alta California at 36 degrees, 30 minutes, the line of the Missouri Compromise.
454	1951	Instead, the passing of the Compromise of 1850 enabled California to be admitted to the Union as a free state, preventing southern California from becoming its own separate slave state.
455	1952	Subsequently, Californios (dissatisfied with inequitable taxes and land laws) and pro-slavery southerners in the lightly populated "Cow Counties" of southern California attempted three times in the 1850s to achieve a separate statehood or territorial status separate from Northern California.
455	1953	The last attempt, the Pico Act of 1859, was passed by the California State Legislature and signed by the State governor John B. Weller.
455	1954	It was approved overwhelmingly by nearly 75% of voters in the proposed Territory of Colorado.
455	1955	This territory was to include all the counties up to the then much larger Tulare County (that included what is now Kings, most of Kern, and part of Inyo counties) and San Luis Obispo County.
455	1956	The proposal was sent to Washington, D.C. with a strong advocate in Senator Milton Latham.
455	1957	However, the secession crisis following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led to the proposal never coming to a vote.
456	1958	In 1900, the Los Angeles Times defined southern California as including "the seven counties of Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, San Diego, Ventura and Santa Barbara."
456	1959	In 1999, the Times added a newer county—Imperial—to that list.
457	1960	The state is most commonly divided and promoted by its regional tourism groups as consisting of northern, central, and southern California regions.
457	1961	The two AAA Auto Clubs of the state, the California State Automobile Association and the Automobile Club of Southern California, choose to simplify matters by dividing the state along the lines where their jurisdictions for membership apply, as either northern or southern California, in contrast to the three-region point of view.
457	1962	Another influence is the geographical phrase South of the Tehachapis, which would split the southern region off at the crest of that transverse range, but in that definition, the desert portions of north Los Angeles County and eastern Kern and San Bernardino Counties would be included in the southern California region due to their remoteness from the central valley and interior desert landscape.
458	1963	Southern California consists of a heavily developed urban environment, home to some of the largest urban areas in the state, along with vast areas that have been left undeveloped.
458	1964	It is the third most populated megalopolis in the United States, after the Great Lakes Megalopolis and the Northeastern megalopolis.
458	1965	Much of southern California is famous for its large, spread-out, suburban communities and use of automobiles and highways.
458	1966	The dominant areas are Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, and Riverside-San Bernardino, each of which is the center of its respective metropolitan area, composed of numerous smaller cities and communities.
458	1967	The urban area is also host to an international metropolitan region in the form of San Diego–Tijuana, created by the urban area spilling over into Baja California.
459	1968	Traveling south on Interstate 5, the main gap to continued urbanization is Camp Pendleton.
459	1969	The cities and communities along Interstate 15 and Interstate 215 are so inter-related that Temecula and Murrieta have as much connection with the San Diego metropolitan area as they do with the Inland Empire.
459	1970	To the east, the United States Census Bureau considers the San Bernardino and Riverside County areas, Riverside-San Bernardino area as a separate metropolitan area from Los Angeles County.
459	1971	While many commute to L.A. and Orange Counties, there are some differences in development, as most of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties (the non-desert portions) were developed in the 1980s and 1990s.
459	1972	Newly developed exurbs formed in the Antelope Valley north of Los Angeles, the Victor Valley and the Coachella Valley with the Imperial Valley.
459	1973	Also, population growth was high in the Bakersfield-Kern County, Santa Maria and San Luis Obispo areas.
460	1974	Southern California contains a Mediterranean climate, with infrequent rain and many sunny days.
460	1975	Summers are hot and dry, while winters are a bit warm or mild and wet.
460	1976	In the summers, temperature ranges are 90-60's while as winters are 70-50's, usually all of Southern California have Mediterranean climate.
460	1977	But snow is very rare in the Southwest of the state, it occurs on the Southeast of the state.
461	1978	Southern California consists of one of the more varied collections of geologic, topographic, and natural ecosystem landscapes in a diversity outnumbering other major regions in the state and country.
461	1979	The region spans from Pacific Ocean islands, shorelines, beaches, and coastal plains, through the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges with their peaks, into the large and small interior valleys, to the vast deserts of California.
462	1980	Each year, the southern California area has about 10,000 earthquakes.
462	1981	Nearly all of them are so small that they are not felt.
462	1982	Only several hundred are greater than magnitude 3.0, and only about 15–20 are greater than magnitude 4.0.
462	1983	The magnitude 6.7 1994 Northridge earthquake was particularly destructive, causing a substantial number of deaths, injuries, and structural collapses.
462	1984	It caused the most property damage of any earthquake in U.S. history, estimated at over $20 billion.
463	1985	Many faults are able to produce a magnitude 6.7+ earthquake, such as the San Andreas Fault, which can produce a magnitude 8.0 event.
463	1986	Other faults include the San Jacinto Fault, the Puente Hills Fault, and the Elsinore Fault Zone.
463	1987	The USGS has released a California Earthquake forecast which models Earthquake occurrence in California.
464	1988	Southern California is divided culturally, politically, and economically into distinctive regions, each containing its own culture and atmosphere, anchored usually by a city with both national and sometimes global recognition, which are often the hub of economic activity for its respective region and being home to many tourist destinations.
464	1989	Each region is further divided into many culturally distinct areas but as a whole combine to create the southern California atmosphere.
465	1990	As of the 2010 United States Census, southern California has a population of 22,680,010.
465	1991	Despite a reputation for high growth rates, southern California's rate grew less than the state average of 10.0% in the 2000s as California's growth became concentrated in the northern part of the state due to a stronger, tech-oriented economy in the Bay Area and an emerging Greater Sacramento region.
466	1992	Southern California consists of one Combined Statistical Area, eight Metropolitan Statistical Areas, one international metropolitan area, and multiple metropolitan divisions.
466	1993	The region is home to two extended metropolitan areas that exceed five million in population.
466	1994	These are the Greater Los Angeles Area at 17,786,419, and San Diego–Tijuana at 5,105,768.
466	1995	Of these metropolitan areas, the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana metropolitan area, Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area, and Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura metropolitan area form Greater Los Angeles; while the El Centro metropolitan area and San Diego-Carlsbad-San Marcos metropolitan area form the Southern Border Region.
466	1996	North of Greater Los Angeles are the Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Bakersfield metropolitan areas.
467	1997	Los Angeles (at 3.7 million people) and San Diego (at 1.3 million people), both in southern California, are the two largest cities in all of California (and two of the eight largest cities in the United States).
467	1998	In southern California there are also twelve cities with more than 200,000 residents and 34 cities over 100,000 in population.
467	1999	Many of southern California's most developed cities lie along or in close proximity to the coast, with the exception of San Bernardino and Riverside.
468	2000	Southern California's economy is diverse and one of the largest in the United States.
468	2001	It is dominated and heavily dependent upon abundance of petroleum, as opposed to other regions where automobiles not nearly as dominant, the vast majority of transport runs on this fuel.
468	2002	Southern California is famous for tourism and Hollywood (film, television, and music).
468	2003	Other industries include software, automotive, ports, finance, tourism, biomedical, and regional logistics.
468	2004	The region was a leader in the housing bubble 2001–2007, and has been heavily impacted by the housing crash.
469	2005	Since the 1920s, motion pictures, petroleum and aircraft manufacturing have been major industries.
469	2006	In one of the richest agricultural regions in the U.S., cattle and citrus were major industries until farmlands were turned into suburbs.
469	2007	Although military spending cutbacks have had an impact, aerospace continues to be a major factor.
470	2008	Southern California is home to many major business districts.
470	2009	Central business districts (CBD) include Downtown Los Angeles, Downtown San Diego, Downtown San Bernardino, Downtown Bakersfield, South Coast Metro and Downtown Riverside.
471	2010	Within the Los Angeles Area are the major business districts of Downtown Burbank, Downtown Santa Monica, Downtown Glendale and Downtown Long Beach.
471	2011	Los Angeles itself has many business districts including the Downtown Los Angeles central business district as well as those lining the Wilshire Boulevard Miracle Mile including Century City, Westwood and Warner Center in the San Fernando Valley.
472	2012	The San Bernardino-Riverside area maintains the business districts of Downtown San Bernardino, Hospitality Business/Financial Centre, University Town which are in San Bernardino and Downtown Riverside.
473	2013	Orange County is a rapidly developing business center that includes Downtown Santa Ana, the South Coast Metro and Newport Center districts; as well as the Irvine business centers of The Irvine Spectrum, West Irvine, and international corporations headquartered at the University of California, Irvine.
473	2014	West Irvine includes the Irvine Tech Center and Jamboree Business Parks.
474	2015	Downtown San Diego is the central business district of San Diego, though the city is filled with business districts.
474	2016	These include Carmel Valley, Del Mar Heights, Mission Valley, Rancho Bernardo, Sorrento Mesa, and University City.
474	2017	Most of these districts are located in Northern San Diego and some within North County regions.
475	2018	Southern California is home to Los Angeles International Airport, the second-busiest airport in the United States by passenger volume (see World's busiest airports by passenger traffic) and the third by international passenger volume (see Busiest airports in the United States by international passenger traffic); San Diego International Airport the busiest single runway airport in the world; Van Nuys Airport, the world's busiest general aviation airport; major commercial airports at Orange County, Bakersfield, Ontario, Burbank and Long Beach; and numerous smaller commercial and general aviation airports.
476	2019	Six of the seven lines of the commuter rail system, Metrolink, run out of Downtown Los Angeles, connecting Los Angeles, Ventura, San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange, and San Diego counties with the other line connecting San Bernardino, Riverside, and Orange counties directly.
477	2020	Southern California is also home to the Port of Los Angeles, the United States' busiest commercial port; the adjacent Port of Long Beach, the United States' second busiest container port; and the Port of San Diego.
478	2021	The Tech Coast is a moniker that has gained use as a descriptor for the region's diversified technology and industrial base as well as its multitude of prestigious and world-renowned research universities and other public and private institutions.
478	2022	Amongst these include 5 University of California campuses (Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, Santa Barbara, and San Diego); 12 California State University campuses (Bakersfield, Channel Islands, Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Northridge, Pomona, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Marcos, and San Luis Obispo); and private institutions such as the California Institute of Technology, Chapman University, the Claremont Colleges (Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College, Pitzer College, Pomona College, and Scripps College), Loma Linda University, Loyola Marymount University, Occidental College, Pepperdine University, University of Redlands, University of San Diego, and the University of Southern California.
479	2023	Professional sports teams in Southern California include teams from the NFL (Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers); NBA (Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers); MLB (Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, San Diego Padres); NHL (Los Angeles Kings, Anaheim Ducks); and MLS (LA Galaxy).
480	2024	From 2005 to 2014, there were two Major League Soccer teams in Los Angeles — the LA Galaxy and Chivas USA — that both played at the StubHub Center and were local rivals.
480	2025	However, Chivas were suspended following the 2014 MLS season, with a second MLS team scheduled to return in 2018.
481	2026	College sports are also popular in southern California.
481	2027	The UCLA Bruins and the USC Trojans both field teams in NCAA Division I in the Pac-12 Conference, and there is a longtime rivalry between the schools.
482	2028	Rugby is also a growing sport in southern California, particularly at the high school level, with increasing numbers of schools adding rugby as an official school sport.
483	2029	Formed in November 1990 by the equal merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting, BSkyB became the UK's largest digital subscription television company.
483	2030	Following BSkyB's 2014 acquisition of Sky Italia and a majority 90.04% interest in Sky Deutschland in November 2014, its holding company British Sky Broadcasting Group plc changed its name to Sky plc.
483	2031	The United Kingdom operations also changed the company name from British Sky Broadcasting Limited to Sky UK Limited, still trading as Sky.
484	2032	Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission, which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer, BSkyB's monopoly came to an end from the 2007–08 season.
484	2033	In May 2006, the Irish broadcaster Setanta Sports was awarded two of the six Premier League packages that the English FA offered to broadcasters.
484	2034	Sky picked up the remaining four for £1.3bn.
484	2035	In February 2015, Sky bid £4.2bn for a package of 120 premier league games across the three seasons from 2016.
484	2036	This represented an increase of 70% on the previous contract and was said to be £1bn more than the company had expected to pay.
484	2037	The move has been followed by staff cuts, increased subscription prices (including 9% in Sky's family package) and the dropping of the 3D channel.
485	2038	While BSkyB had been excluded from being a part of the ONdigital consortium, thereby making them a competitor by default, BSkyB was able to join ITV Digital's free-to-air replacement, Freeview, in which it holds an equal stake with the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and National Grid Wireless.
485	2039	Prior to October 2005, three BSkyB channels were available on this platform: Sky News, Sky Three, and Sky Sports News.
485	2040	Initially BSkyB provided Sky Travel to the service.
485	2041	However, this was replaced by Sky Three on 31 October 2005, which was itself later re-branded as 'Pick TV' in 2011.
486	2042	BSkyB initially charged additional subscription fees for using a Sky+ PVR with their service; waiving the charge for subscribers whose package included two or more premium channels.
486	2043	This changed as from 1 July 2007, and now customers that have Sky+ and subscribe to any BSkyB subscription package get Sky+ included at no extra charge.
486	2044	Customers that do not subscribe to BSkyB's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions.
486	2045	In January 2010 BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box, limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+HD Box as standard, thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+.
486	2046	In February 2011 BSkyB discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box, offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality.
486	2047	In September 2007, Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky+ at women.
486	2048	As of 31 March 2008, Sky had 3,393,000 Sky+ users.
487	2049	BSkyB utilises the VideoGuard pay-TV scrambling system owned by NDS, a Cisco Systems company.
487	2050	There are tight controls over use of VideoGuard decoders; they are not available as stand-alone DVB CAMs (conditional-access modules).
487	2051	BSkyB has design authority over all digital satellite receivers capable of receiving their service.
487	2052	The receivers, though designed and built by different manufacturers, must conform to the same user interface look-and-feel as all the others.
487	2053	This extends to the Personal video recorder (PVR) offering (branded Sky+).
488	2054	In 2007, BSkyB and Virgin Media became involved in a dispute over the carriage of Sky channels on cable TV.
488	2055	The failure to renew the existing carriage agreements negotiated with NTL and Telewest resulted in Virgin Media removing the basic channels from the network on 1 March 2007.
488	2056	Virgin Media claimed that BSkyB had substantially increased the asking price for the channels, a claim which BSkyB denied, on the basis that their new deal offered "substantially more value" by including HD channels and Video On Demand content which was not previously carried by cable.
489	2057	In July 2013, the English High Court of Justice found that Microsoft’s use of the term "SkyDrive" infringed on Sky’s right to the "Sky" trademark.
489	2058	On 31 July 2013, BSkyB and Microsoft announced their settlement, in which Microsoft will not appeal the ruling, and will rename its SkyDrive cloud storage service after an unspecified "reasonable period of time to allow for an orderly transition to a new brand," plus "financial and other terms, the details of which are confidential".
489	2059	On 27 January 2014, Microsoft announced "that SkyDrive will soon become OneDrive" and "SkyDrive Pro" becomes "OneDrive for Business".
490	2060	The service started on 1 September 1993 based on the idea from the then chief executive officer, Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch, of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept.
490	2061	The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air, broadcasting on Astra's satellites, as well as introducing new channels.
490	2062	The service continued until the closure of BSkyB's analogue service on 27 September 2001, due to the launch and expansion of the Sky Digital platform.
490	2063	Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted (whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode, without a subscription card) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package.
490	2064	Within two months of the launch, BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers, with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well, which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994.
490	2065	Michael Grade criticized the operations in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage, mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels.
491	2066	Sky UK Limited (formerly British Sky Broadcasting or BSkyB) is a British telecommunications company which serves the United Kingdom.
491	2067	Sky provides television and broadband internet services and fixed line telephone services to consumers and businesses in the United Kingdom.
491	2068	It is the UK's largest pay-TV broadcaster with 11 million customers as of 2015.
491	2069	It was the UK's most popular digital TV service until it was overtaken by Freeview in April 2007.
491	2070	Its corporate headquarters are based in Isleworth.
492	2071	On 18 November 2015, Sky announced Sky Q, a range of products and services to be available in 2016.
492	2072	The Sky Q range consists of three set top boxes (Sky Q, Sky Q Silver and Sky Q Mini), a broadband router (Sky Q Hub) and mobile applications.
492	2073	The Sky Q set top boxes introduce a new user interface, Wi-Fi hotspot functionality, Power-line and Bluetooth connectivity and a new touch-sensitive remote control.
492	2074	The Sky Q Mini set top boxes connect to the Sky Q Silver set top boxes with a Wi-Fi or Power-line connection rather than receive their own satellite feeds.
492	2075	This allows all set top boxes in a household to share recordings and other media.
492	2076	The Sky Q Silver set top box is capable of receiving and displaying UHD broadcasts, which Sky will introduce later in 2016.
493	2077	BSkyB's standard definition broadcasts are in DVB-compliant MPEG-2, with the Sky Movies and Sky Box Office channels including optional Dolby Digital soundtracks for recent films, although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box.
493	2078	Sky+ HD material is broadcast using MPEG-4 and most of the HD material uses the DVB-S2 standard.
493	2079	Interactive services and 7-day EPG use the proprietary OpenTV system, with set-top boxes including modems for a return path.
493	2080	Sky News, amongst other channels, provides a pseudo-video on demand interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams.
494	2081	When Sky Digital was launched in 1998 the new service used the Astra 2A satellite which was located at the 28.5°E orbital position, unlike the analogue service which was broadcast from 19.2°E.
494	2082	This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as Eutelsat's Eurobird 1 (now Eutelsat 33C) at 28.5°E), enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service, Sky, with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels.
494	2083	The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries, while the new position at 28.5°E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom.
495	2084	BSkyB launched its HDTV service, Sky+ HD, on 22 May 2006.
495	2085	Prior to its launch, BSkyB claimed that 40,000 people had registered to receive the HD service.
495	2086	In the week before the launch, rumours started to surface that BSkyB was having supply issues with its set top box (STB) from manufacturer Thomson.
495	2087	On Thursday 18 May 2006, and continuing through the weekend before launch, people were reporting that BSkyB had either cancelled or rescheduled its installation.
495	2088	Finally, the BBC reported that 17,000 customers had yet to receive the service due to failed deliveries.
495	2089	On 31 March 2012, Sky announced the total number of homes with Sky+HD was 4,222,000.
496	2090	On 8 February 2007, BSkyB announced its intention to replace its three free-to-air digital terrestrial channels with four subscription channels.
496	2091	It was proposed that these channels would offer a range of content from the BSkyB portfolio including sport (including English Premier League Football), films, entertainment and news.
496	2092	The announcement came a day after Setanta Sports confirmed that it would launch in March as a subscription service on the digital terrestrial platform, and on the same day that NTL's services re-branded as Virgin Media.
496	2093	However, industry sources believe BSkyB will be forced to shelve plans to withdraw its channels from Freeview and replace them with subscription channels, due to possible lost advertising revenue.
497	2094	Provided is a universal Ku band LNB (9.75/10.600 GHz) which is fitted at the end of the dish and pointed at the correct satellite constellation; most digital receivers will receive the free to air channels.
497	2095	Some broadcasts are free-to-air and unencrypted, some are encrypted but do not require a monthly subscription (known as free-to-view), some are encrypted and require a monthly subscription, and some are pay-per-view services.
497	2096	To view the encrypted content a VideoGuard UK equipped receiver (all of which are dedicated to the Sky service, and cannot be used to decrypt other services) needs to be used.
497	2097	Unofficial CAMs are now available to view the service, although use of them breaks the user's contract with Sky and invalidates the user's rights to use the card.
498	2098	In the autumn of 1991, talks were held for the broadcast rights for Premier League for a five-year period, from the 1992 season.
498	2099	ITV were the current rights holders, and fought hard to retain the new rights.
498	2100	ITV had increased its offer from £18m to £34m per year to keep control of the rights.
498	2101	BSkyB joined forces with the BBC to make a counter bid.
498	2102	The BBC was given the highlights of most of the matches, while BSkyB paying £304m for the Premier League rights, would give them a monopoly of all live matches, up to 60 per year from the 1992 season.
498	2103	Murdoch described sport as a "battering ram" for pay-television, providing a strong customer base.
498	2104	A few weeks after the deal, ITV went to the High Court to get an injunction as it believed their bid details had been leaked before the decision was taken.
498	2105	ITV also asked the Office of Fair Trading to investigate since it believed Rupert Murdoch's media empire via its newspapers had influenced the deal.
498	2106	A few days later neither action took effect, ITV believed BSkyB was telephoned and informed of its £262m bid, and Premier League advised BSkyB to increase its counter bid.
499	2107	BSkyB has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG, with open access being an enforced part of their operating licence from Ofcom.
499	2108	Any channel which can get carriage on a suitable beam of a satellite at 28° East is entitled to access to BSkyB's EPG for a fee, ranging from £15–100,000.
499	2109	Third-party channels which opt for encryption receive discounts ranging from reduced price to free EPG entries, free carriage on a BSkyB leased transponder, or actual payment for being carried.
499	2110	However, even in this case, BSkyB does not carry any control over the channel's content or carriage issues such as picture quality.
500	2111	BSkyB's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital, although small-scale tests were carried out before then.
500	2112	At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky's analogue services.
500	2113	Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality, increased number of channels and an interactive service branded Open.... now called Sky Active, BSkyB competed with the ONdigital (later ITV Digital) terrestrial offering and cable services.
500	2114	Within 30 days, over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold, which help bolstered BSkyB's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999.
501	2115	Virgin Media (re-branded in 2007 from NTL:Telewest) started to offer a high-definition television (HDTV) capable set top box, although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel, BBC HD, after the conclusion of the ITV HD trial.
501	2116	Virgin Media has claimed that other HD channels were "locked up" or otherwise withheld from their platform, although Virgin Media did in fact have an option to carry Channel 4 HD in the future.
501	2117	Nonetheless, the linear channels were not offered, Virgin Media instead concentrating on its Video On Demand service to carry a modest selection of HD content.
501	2118	Virgin Media has nevertheless made a number of statements over the years, suggesting that more linear HD channels are on the way.
502	2119	BSkyB's direct-to-home satellite service became available in 10 million homes in 2010, Europe's first pay-TV platform in to achieve that milestone.
502	2120	Confirming it had reached its target, the broadcaster said its reach into 36% of households in the UK represented an audience of more than 25m people.
502	2121	The target was first announced in August 2004, since then an additional 2.4m customers had subscribed to BSkyB's direct-to-home service.
502	2122	Media commentators had debated whether the figure could be reached as the growth in subscriber numbers elsewhere in Europe flattened.
503	2123	The Daily Mail newspaper reported in 2012 that the UK government's benefits agency was checking claimants' "Sky TV bills to establish if a woman in receipt of benefits as a single mother is wrongly claiming to be living alone" – as, it claimed, subscription to sports channels would betray a man's presence in the household.
503	2124	In December, the UK’s parliament heard a claim that a subscription to BSkyB was ‘often damaging’, along with alcohol, tobacco and gambling.
503	2125	Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke was proposing the payments of benefits and tax credits on a "Welfare Cash Card", in the style of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, that could be used to buy only "essentials".
504	2126	The agreements include fixed annual carriage fees of £30m for the channels with both channel suppliers able to secure additional capped payments if their channels meet certain performance-related targets.
504	2127	Currently there is no indication as to whether the new deal includes the additional Video On Demand and High Definition content which had previously been offered by BSkyB.
504	2128	As part of the agreements, both BSkyB and Virgin Media agreed to terminate all High Court proceedings against each other relating to the carriage of their respective basic channels.
505	2129	The economy of Victoria is highly diversified: service sectors including financial and property services, health, education, wholesale, retail, hospitality and manufacturing constitute the majority of employment.
505	2130	Victoria's total gross state product (GSP) is ranked second in Australia, although Victoria is ranked fourth in terms of GSP per capita because of its limited mining activity.
505	2131	Culturally, Melbourne is home to a number of museums, art galleries and theatres and is also described as the "sporting capital of Australia".
505	2132	The Melbourne Cricket Ground is the largest stadium in Australia, and the host of the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Commonwealth Games.
505	2133	The ground is also considered the "spiritual home" of Australian cricket and Australian rules football, and hosts the grand final of the Australian Football League (AFL) each year, usually drawing crowds of over 95,000 people.
505	2134	Victoria includes eight public universities, with the oldest, the University of Melbourne, having been founded in 1853.
506	2135	Immigrants arrived from all over the world to search for gold, especially from Ireland and China.
506	2136	Many Chinese miners worked in Victoria, and their legacy is particularly strong in Bendigo and its environs.
506	2137	Although there was some racism directed at them, there was not the level of anti-Chinese violence that was seen at the Lambing Flat riots in New South Wales.
506	2138	However, there was a riot at Buckland Valley near Bright in 1857.
506	2139	Conditions on the gold fields were cramped and unsanitary; an outbreak of typhoid at Buckland Valley in 1854 killed over 1,000 miners.
507	2140	In November 2006, the Victorian Legislative Council elections were held under a new multi-member proportional representation system.
507	2141	The State of Victoria was divided into eight electorates with each electorate represented by five representatives elected by Single Transferable Vote.
507	2142	The total number of upper house members was reduced from 44 to 40 and their term of office is now the same as the lower house members—four years.
507	2143	Elections for the Victorian Parliament are now fixed and occur in November every four years.
507	2144	Prior to the 2006 election, the Legislative Council consisted of 44 members elected to eight-year terms from 22 two-member electorates.
508	2145	The centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP), the centre-right Liberal Party of Australia, the rural-based National Party of Australia, and the environmentalist Australian Greens are Victoria's main political parties.
508	2146	Traditionally, Labor is strongest in Melbourne's working class western and northern suburbs, and the regional cities of Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong.
508	2147	The Liberals' main support lies in Melbourne's more affluent eastern and outer suburbs, and some rural and regional centres.
508	2148	The Nationals are strongest in Victoria's North Western and Eastern rural regional areas.
508	2149	The Greens, who won their first lower house seats in 2014, are strongest in inner Melbourne.
509	2150	About 61.1% of Victorians describe themselves as Christian.
509	2151	Roman Catholics form the single largest religious group in the state with 26.7% of the Victorian population, followed by Anglicans and members of the Uniting Church.
509	2152	Buddhism is the state's largest non-Christian religion, with 168,637 members as of the most recent census.
509	2153	Victoria is also home of 152,775 Muslims and 45,150 Jews.
509	2154	Hinduism is the fastest growing religion.
509	2155	Around 20% of Victorians claim no religion.
509	2156	Amongst those who declare a religious affiliation, church attendance is low.
510	2157	Victoria (abbreviated as Vic) is a state in the south-east of Australia.
510	2158	Victoria is Australia's most densely populated state and its second-most populous state overall.
510	2159	Most of its population is concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay, which includes the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Melbourne, which is Australia's second-largest city.
510	2160	Geographically the smallest state on the Australian mainland, Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south,[note 1] New South Wales to the north, the Tasman Sea to the east, and South Australia to the west.
511	2161	Prior to European settlement, the area now constituting Victoria was inhabited by a large number of Aboriginal peoples, collectively known as the Koori.
511	2162	With Great Britain having claimed the entire Australian continent east of the 135th meridian east in 1788, Victoria was included in the wider colony of New South Wales.
511	2163	The first settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay, and much of what is now Victoria was included in the Port Phillip District in 1836, an administrative division of New South Wales.
511	2164	Victoria was officially created a separate colony in 1851, and achieved self-government in 1855.
511	2165	The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony, and by the Federation of Australia in 1901, Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia.
511	2166	Melbourne also served as capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927, with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne.
512	2167	More than 26,000 square kilometres (10,000 sq mi) of Victorian farmland are sown for grain, mostly in the state's west.
512	2168	More than 50% of this area is sown for wheat, 33% for barley and 7% for oats.
512	2169	A further 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) is sown for hay.
512	2170	In 2003–04, Victorian farmers produced more than 3 million tonnes of wheat and 2 million tonnes of barley.
512	2171	Victorian farms produce nearly 90% of Australian pears and third of apples.
512	2172	It is also a leader in stone fruit production.
512	2173	The main vegetable crops include asparagus, broccoli, carrots, potatoes and tomatoes.
512	2174	Last year, 121,200 tonnes of pears and 270,000 tonnes of tomatoes were produced.
513	2175	Victoria has a written constitution enacted in 1975, but based on the 1855 colonial constitution, passed by the United Kingdom Parliament as the Victoria Constitution Act 1855, which establishes the Parliament as the state's law-making body for matters coming under state responsibility.
513	2176	The Victorian Constitution can be amended by the Parliament of Victoria, except for certain "entrenched" provisions that require either an absolute majority in both houses, a three-fifths majority in both houses, or the approval of the Victorian people in a referendum, depending on the provision.
514	2177	The Mallee and upper Wimmera are Victoria's warmest regions with hot winds blowing from nearby semi-deserts.
514	2178	Average temperatures exceed 32 °C (90 °F) during summer and 15 °C (59 °F) in winter.
514	2179	Except at cool mountain elevations, the inland monthly temperatures are 2–7 °C (4–13 °F) warmer than around Melbourne (see chart).
514	2180	Victoria's highest maximum temperature since World War II, of 48.8 °C (119.8 °F) was recorded in Hopetoun on 7 February 2009, during the 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave.
515	2181	Victorian schools are either publicly or privately funded.
515	2182	Public schools, also known as state or government schools, are funded and run directly by the Victoria Department of Education .
515	2183	Students do not pay tuition fees, but some extra costs are levied.
515	2184	Private fee-paying schools include parish schools run by the Roman Catholic Church and independent schools similar to British public schools.
515	2185	Independent schools are usually affiliated with Protestant churches.
515	2186	Victoria also has several private Jewish and Islamic primary and secondary schools.
515	2187	Private schools also receive some public funding.
515	2188	All schools must comply with government-set curriculum standards.
515	2189	In addition, Victoria has four government selective schools, Melbourne High School for boys, MacRobertson Girls' High School for girls, the coeducational schools John Monash Science School, Nossal High School and Suzanne Cory High School, and The Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School.
515	2190	Students at these schools are exclusively admitted on the basis of an academic selective entry test.
516	2191	Historically, Victoria has been the base for the manufacturing plants of the major car brands Ford, Toyota and Holden; however, closure announcements by all three companies in the 21st century will mean that Australia will no longer be a base for the global car industry, with Toyota's statement in February 2014 outlining a closure year of 2017.
516	2192	Holden's announcement occurred in May 2013, followed by Ford's decision in December of the same year (Ford's Victorian plants—in Broadmeadows and Geelong—will close in October 2016).
517	2193	Victoria contains many topographically, geologically and climatically diverse areas, ranging from the wet, temperate climate of Gippsland in the southeast to the snow-covered Victorian alpine areas which rise to almost 2,000 m (6,600 ft), with Mount Bogong the highest peak at 1,986 m (6,516 ft).
517	2194	There are extensive semi-arid plains to the west and northwest.
517	2195	There is an extensive series of river systems in Victoria.
517	2196	Most notable is the Murray River system.
517	2197	Other rivers include: Ovens River, Goulburn River, Patterson River, King River, Campaspe River, Loddon River, Wimmera River, Elgin River, Barwon River, Thomson River, Snowy River, Latrobe River, Yarra River, Maribyrnong River, Mitta River, Hopkins River, Merri River and Kiewa River.
517	2198	The state symbols include the pink heath (state flower), Leadbeater's possum (state animal) and the helmeted honeyeater (state bird).
518	2199	The Victorian Alps in the northeast are the coldest part of Victoria.
518	2200	The Alps are part of the Great Dividing Range mountain system extending east-west through the centre of Victoria.
518	2201	Average temperatures are less than 9 °C (48 °F) in winter and below 0 °C (32 °F) in the highest parts of the ranges.
518	2202	The state's lowest minimum temperature of −11.7 °C (10.9 °F) was recorded at Omeo on 13 June 1965, and again at Falls Creek on 3 July 1970.
518	2203	Temperature extremes for the state are listed in the table below:
519	2204	Rail transport in Victoria is provided by several private and public railway operators who operate over government-owned lines.
519	2205	Major operators include: Metro Trains Melbourne which runs an extensive, electrified, passenger system throughout Melbourne and suburbs; V/Line which is now owned by the Victorian Government, operates a concentrated service to major regional centres, as well as long distance services on other lines; Pacific National, CFCL Australia which operate freight services; Great Southern Rail which operates The Overland Melbourne—Adelaide; and NSW TrainLink which operates XPTs Melbourne—Sydney.
520	2206	Politically, Victoria has 37 seats in the Australian House of Representatives and 12 seats in the Australian Senate.
520	2207	At state level, the Parliament of Victoria consists of the Legislative Assembly (the lower house) and the Legislative Council (the upper house).
520	2208	Victoria is currently governed by the Labor Party, with Daniel Andrews the current Premier.
520	2209	The personal representative of the Queen of Australia in the state is the Governor of Victoria, currently Linda Dessau.
520	2210	Local government is concentrated in 79 municipal districts, including 33 cities, although a number of unincorporated areas still exist, which are administered directly by the state.
521	2211	On 1 July 1851, writs were issued for the election of the first Victorian Legislative Council, and the absolute independence of Victoria from New South Wales was established proclaiming a new Colony of Victoria.
521	2212	Days later, still in 1851 gold was discovered near Ballarat, and subsequently at Bendigo.
521	2213	Later discoveries occurred at many sites across Victoria.
521	2214	This triggered one of the largest gold rushes the world has ever seen.
521	2215	The colony grew rapidly in both population and economic power.
521	2216	In ten years the population of Victoria increased sevenfold from 76,000 to 540,000.
521	2217	All sorts of gold records were produced including the "richest shallow alluvial goldfield in the world" and the largest gold nugget.
521	2218	Victoria produced in the decade 1851–1860 20 million ounces of gold, one third of the world's output[citation needed].
522	2219	As of August 2010, Victoria had 1,548 public schools, 489 Catholic schools and 214 independent schools.
522	2220	Just under 540,800 students were enrolled in public schools, and just over 311,800 in private schools.
522	2221	Over 61 per cent of private students attend Catholic schools.
522	2222	More than 462,000 students were enrolled in primary schools and more than 390,000 in secondary schools.
522	2223	Retention rates for the final two years of secondary school were 77 per cent for public school students and 90 per cent for private school students.
522	2224	Victoria has about 63,519 full-time teachers.
523	2225	Victoria is the centre of dairy farming in Australia.
523	2226	It is home to 60% of Australia's 3 million dairy cattle and produces nearly two-thirds of the nation's milk, almost 6.4 billion litres.
523	2227	The state also has 2.4 million beef cattle, with more than 2.2 million cattle and calves slaughtered each year.
523	2228	In 2003–04, Victorian commercial fishing crews and aquaculture industry produced 11,634 tonnes of seafood valued at nearly A$109 million.
523	2229	Blacklipped abalone is the mainstay of the catch, bringing in A$46 million, followed by southern rock lobster worth A$13.7 million.
523	2230	Most abalone and rock lobster is exported to Asia.
524	2231	There are also several smaller freight operators and numerous tourist railways operating over lines which were once parts of a state-owned system.
524	2232	Victorian lines mainly use the 1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) broad gauge.
524	2233	However, the interstate trunk routes, as well as a number of branch lines in the west of the state have been converted to 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1⁄2 in) standard gauge.
524	2234	Two tourist railways operate over 760 mm (2 ft 6 in) narrow gauge lines, which are the remnants of five formerly government-owned lines which were built in mountainous areas.
525	2235	After the founding of the colony of New South Wales in 1788, Australia was divided into an eastern half named New South Wales and a western half named New Holland, under the administration of the colonial government in Sydney.
525	2236	The first European settlement in the area later known as Victoria was established in October 1803 under Lieutenant-Governor David Collins at Sullivan Bay on Port Phillip.
525	2237	It consisted of 402 people (5 Government officials, 9 officers of marines, 2 drummers, and 39 privates, 5 soldiers' wives, and a child, 307 convicts, 17 convicts' wives, and 7 children).
525	2238	They had been sent from England in HMS Calcutta under the command of Captain Daniel Woodriff, principally out of fear that the French, who had been exploring the area, might establish their own settlement and thereby challenge British rights to the continent.
526	2239	In 1854 at Ballarat there was an armed rebellion against the government of Victoria by miners protesting against mining taxes (the "Eureka Stockade").
526	2240	This was crushed by British troops, but the discontents prompted colonial authorities to reform the administration (particularly reducing the hated mining licence fees) and extend the franchise.
526	2241	Within a short time, the Imperial Parliament granted Victoria responsible government with the passage of the Colony of Victoria Act 1855.
526	2242	Some of the leaders of the Eureka rebellion went on to become members of the Victorian Parliament.
527	2243	The Premier of Victoria is the leader of the political party or coalition with the most seats in the Legislative Assembly.
527	2244	The Premier is the public face of government and, with cabinet, sets the legislative and political agenda.
527	2245	Cabinet consists of representatives elected to either house of parliament.
527	2246	It is responsible for managing areas of government that are not exclusively the Commonwealth's, by the Australian Constitution, such as education, health and law enforcement.
527	2247	The current Premier of Victoria is Daniel Andrews.
528	2248	During 2003–04, the gross value of Victorian agricultural production increased by 17% to $8.7 billion.
528	2249	This represented 24% of national agricultural production total gross value.
528	2250	As of 2004, an estimated 32,463 farms occupied around 136,000 square kilometres (52,500 sq mi) of Victorian land.
528	2251	This comprises more than 60% of the state's total land surface.
528	2252	Victorian farms range from small horticultural outfits to large-scale livestock and grain productions.
528	2253	A quarter of farmland is used to grow consumable crops.
529	2254	Major events also play a big part in tourism in Victoria, particularly cultural tourism and sports tourism.
529	2255	Most of these events are centred on Melbourne, but others occur in regional cities, such as the V8 Supercars and Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix at Phillip Island, the Grand Annual Steeplechase at Warrnambool and the Australian International Airshow at Geelong and numerous local festivals such as the popular Port Fairy Folk Festival, Queenscliff Music Festival, Bells Beach SurfClassic and the Bright Autumn Festival.
530	2256	Huguenot numbers peaked near an estimated two million by 1562, concentrated mainly in the southern and central parts of France, about one-eighth the number of French Catholics.
530	2257	As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, Catholic hostility grew, in spite of increasingly liberal political concessions and edicts of toleration from the French crown.
530	2258	A series of religious conflicts followed, known as the Wars of Religion, fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598.
530	2259	The wars finally ended with the granting of the Edict of Nantes, which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.
531	2260	A term used originally in derision, Huguenot has unclear origins.
531	2261	The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in "a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy").
531	2262	Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement.
531	2263	In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the "Confederate Party", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation.
531	2264	The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise.
531	2265	The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss.
531	2266	Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.
532	2267	The availability of the Bible in vernacular languages was important to the spread of the Protestant movement and development of the Reformed church in France.
532	2268	The country had a long history of struggles with the papacy by the time the Protestant Reformation finally arrived.
532	2269	Around 1294, a French version of the Scriptures was prepared by the Roman Catholic priest, Guyard de Moulin.
532	2270	A two-volume illustrated folio paraphrase version based on his manuscript, by Jean de Rély, was printed in Paris in 1487.
533	2271	Montpellier was among the most important of the 66 "villes de sûreté" that the Edict of 1598 granted to the Huguenots.
533	2272	The city's political institutions and the university were all handed over to the Huguenots.
533	2273	Tension with Paris led to a siege by the royal army in 1622.
533	2274	Peace terms called for the dismantling of the city's fortifications.
533	2275	A royal citadel was built and the university and consulate were taken over by the Catholic party.
533	2276	Even before the Edict of Alès (1629), Protestant rule was dead and the ville de sûreté was no more.
534	2277	Individual Huguenots settled at the Cape of Good Hope from as early as 1671 with the arrival of François Villion (Viljoen).
534	2278	The first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was however Maria de la Queillerie, wife of commander Jan van Riebeeck (and daughter of a Walloon church minister), who arrived on 6 April 1652 to establish a settlement at what is today Cape Town.
534	2279	The couple left for the Far East ten years later.
534	2280	On 31 December 1687 the first organised group of Huguenots set sail from the Netherlands to the Dutch East India Company post at the Cape of Good Hope.
534	2281	The largest portion of the Huguenots to settle in the Cape arrived between 1688 and 1689 in seven ships as part of the organised migration, but quite a few arrived as late as 1700; thereafter, the numbers declined and only small groups arrived at a time.
535	2282	Barred by the government from settling in New France, Huguenots led by Jessé de Forest, sailed to North America in 1624 and settled instead in the Dutch colony of New Netherland (later incorporated into New York and New Jersey); as well as Great Britain's colonies, including Nova Scotia.
535	2283	A number of New Amsterdam's families were of Huguenot origin, often having emigrated as refugees to the Netherlands in the previous century.
535	2284	In 1628 the Huguenots established a congregation as L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam (the French church in New Amsterdam).
535	2285	This parish continues today as L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit, part of the Episcopal (Anglican) communion, and welcomes Francophone New Yorkers from all over the world.
535	2286	Upon their arrival in New Amsterdam, Huguenots were offered land directly across from Manhattan on Long Island for a permanent settlement and chose the harbor at the end of Newtown Creek, becoming the first Europeans to live in Brooklyn, then known as Boschwick, in the neighborhood now known as Bushwick.
536	2287	In the early years, many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day Charleston, South Carolina.
536	2288	Elie Prioleau from the town of Pons in France, was among the first to settle there.
536	2289	He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city.
536	2290	After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, several Huguenot families of Norman and Carolingian nobility and descent, including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk England from the Humphrey de Bohun line of French royalty descended from Charlemagne, Jean Postell of Dieppe France, Alexander Pepin, Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France, and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district.
536	2291	They were very successful at marriage and property speculation.
536	2292	After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger.
536	2293	Some of their descendants moved into the Deep South and Texas, where they developed new plantations.
537	2294	Stadtholder William III of Orange, who later became King of England, emerged as the strongest opponent of king Louis XIV after the French attacked the Dutch Republic in 1672.
537	2295	William formed the League of Augsburg as a coalition to oppose Louis and the French state.
537	2296	Consequently, many Huguenots considered the wealthy and Calvinist Dutch Republic, which led the opposition to Louis XIV, as the most attractive country for exile after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.
537	2297	They also found many French-speaking Calvinist churches there.
538	2298	Renewed religious warfare in the 1620s caused the political and military privileges of the Huguenots to be abolished following their defeat.
538	2299	They retained the religious provisions of the Edict of Nantes until the rule of Louis XIV, who progressively increased persecution of them until he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), which abolished all legal recognition of Protestantism in France, and forced the Huguenots to convert.
538	2300	While nearly three-quarters eventually were killed  or submitted, roughly 500,000 Huguenots had fled France by the early 18th century[citation needed].
539	2301	The Catholic Church in France and many of its members opposed the Huguenots.
539	2302	Some Huguenot preachers and congregants were attacked as they attempted to meet for worship.
539	2303	The height of this persecution was the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre when 5,000 to 30,000 were killed, although there were also underlying political reasons for this as well, as some of the Huguenots were nobles trying to establish separate centers of power in southern France.
539	2304	Retaliating against the French Catholics, the Huguenots had their own militia.
540	2305	By 1620 the Huguenots were on the defensive, and the government increasingly applied pressure.
540	2306	A series of three small civil wars known as the Huguenot rebellions broke out, mainly in southwestern France, between 1621 and 1629. revolted against royal authority.
540	2307	The uprising occurred a decade following the death of Henry IV, a Huguenot before converting to Catholicism, who had protected Protestants through the Edict of Nantes.
540	2308	His successor Louis XIII, under the regency of his Italian Catholic mother Marie de' Medici, became more intolerant of Protestantism.
540	2309	The Huguenots respond by establishing independent political and military structures, establishing diplomatic contacts with foreign powers, and openly revolting against central power.
540	2310	The rebellions were implacably suppressed by the French Crown.
541	2311	Approximately one million Protestants in modern France represent some 2% of its population.
541	2312	Most are concentrated in Alsace in northeast France and the Cévennes mountain region in the south, who still regard themselves as Huguenots to this day.
541	2313	[citation needed] A diaspora of French Australians still considers itself Huguenot, even after centuries of exile.
541	2314	Long integrated into Australian society, it is encouraged by the Huguenot Society of Australia to embrace and conserve its cultural heritage, aided by the Society's genealogical research services.
542	2315	Huguenot immigrants did not disperse or settle in different parts of the country, but rather, formed three societies or congregations; one in the city of New York, another 21 miles north of New York in a town which they named New Rochelle, and a third further upstate in New Paltz.
542	2316	The "Huguenot Street Historic District" in New Paltz has been designated a National Historic Landmark site and contains the oldest street in the United States of America.
542	2317	A small group of Huguenots also settled on the south shore of Staten Island along the New York Harbor, for which the current neighborhood of Huguenot was named.
543	2318	After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people.
543	2319	Many came from the region of the Cévennes, for instance, the village of Fraissinet-de-Lozère.
543	2320	This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca.
543	2321	Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot.
543	2322	[citation needed] In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the Dutch Republic in 1715.
543	2323	Huguenots intermarried with Dutch from the outset.
544	2324	In this last connection, the name could suggest the derogatory inference of superstitious worship; popular fancy held that Huguon, the gate of King Hugo, was haunted by the ghost of le roi Huguet (regarded by Roman Catholics as an infamous scoundrel) and other spirits, who instead of being in Purgatory came back to harm the living at night.
544	2325	It was in this place in Tours that the prétendus réformés ("these supposedly 'reformed'") habitually gathered at night, both for political purposes, and for prayer and singing psalms.
544	2326	Such explanations have been traced to the contemporary, Reguier de la Plancha (d. 1560), who in De l'Estat de France offered the following account as to the origin of the name, as cited by The Cape Monthly:
545	2327	Other evidence of the Walloons and Huguenots in Canterbury includes a block of houses in Turnagain Lane, where weavers' windows survive on the top floor, as many Huguenots worked as weavers.
545	2328	The Weavers, a half-timbered house by the river, was the site of a weaving school from the late 16th century to about 1830.
545	2329	(It has been adapted as a restaurant—see illustration above.
545	2330	The house derives its name from a weaving school which was moved there in the last years of the 19th century, reviving an earlier use.)
545	2331	Others refugees practised the variety of occupations necessary to sustain the community as distinct from the indigenous population.
545	2332	Such economic separation was the condition of the refugees' initial acceptance in the City.
545	2333	They also settled elsewhere in Kent, particularly Sandwich, Faversham and Maidstone—towns in which there used to be refugee churches.
546	2334	A number of Huguenots served as mayors in Dublin, Cork, Youghal and Waterford in the 17th and 18th centuries.
546	2335	Numerous signs of Huguenot presence can still be seen with names still in use, and with areas of the main towns and cities named after the people who settled there.
546	2336	Examples include the Huguenot District and French Church Street in Cork City; and D'Olier Street in Dublin, named after a High Sheriff and one of the founders of the Bank of Ireland.
546	2337	A French church in Portarlington dates back to 1696, and was built to serve the significant new Huguenot community in the town.
546	2338	At the time, they constituted the majority of the townspeople.
547	2339	The exodus of Huguenots from France created a brain drain, as many Huguenots had occupied important places in society.
547	2340	The kingdom did not fully recover for years.
547	2341	The French crown's refusal to allow non-Catholics to settle in New France may help to explain that colony's slow rate of population growth compared to that of the neighbouring British colonies, which opened settlement to religious dissenters.
547	2342	By the time of the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War), a sizeable population of Huguenot descent lived in the British colonies, and many participated in the British defeat of New France in 1759-60.
548	2343	The pattern of warfare, followed by brief periods of peace, continued for nearly another quarter-century.
548	2344	The warfare was definitively quelled in 1598, when Henry of Navarre, having succeeded to the French throne as Henry IV, and having recanted Protestantism in favour of Roman Catholicism, issued the Edict of Nantes.
548	2345	The Edict reaffirmed Catholicism as the state religion of France, but granted the Protestants equality with Catholics under the throne and a degree of religious and political freedom within their domains.
548	2346	The Edict simultaneously protected Catholic interests by discouraging the founding of new Protestant churches in Catholic-controlled regions.
549	2347	The revocation forbade Protestant services, required education of children as Catholics, and prohibited emigration.
549	2348	It proved disastrous to the Huguenots and costly for France.
549	2349	It precipitated civil bloodshed, ruined commerce, and resulted in the illegal flight from the country of hundreds of thousands of Protestants, many of whom became intellectuals, doctors and business leaders in Britain as well as Holland, Prussia, and South Africa.
549	2350	Four thousand emigrated to the North American colonies, where they settled in New York and Virginia, especially.
549	2351	The English welcomed the French refugees, providing money from both government and private agencies to aid their relocation.
549	2352	Those Huguenots who stayed in France became Catholics and were called "new converts".
550	2353	The first Huguenots to leave France sought freedom from persecution in Switzerland and the Netherlands.
550	2354	[citation needed] A group of Huguenots was part of the French colonisers who arrived in Brazil in 1555 to found France Antarctique.
550	2355	A couple of ships with around 500 people arrived at the Guanabara Bay, present-day Rio de Janeiro, and settled in a small island.
550	2356	A fort, named Fort Coligny, was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian Native Americans.
550	2357	It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America.
550	2358	The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured part of the Huguenots.
550	2359	The Portuguese threatened the prisoners with death if they did not convert to Catholicism.
550	2360	The Huguenots of Guanabara, as they are now known, produced a declaration of faith to express their beliefs to the Portuguese.
550	2361	This document, the Guanabara Confession of Faith, became the first Protestant confession of faith in the whole of the Americas.
551	2362	Many of the farms in the Western Cape province in South Africa still bear French names.
551	2363	Many families, today mostly Afrikaans-speaking, have surnames indicating their French Huguenot ancestry.
551	2364	Examples include: Blignaut, Cilliers, de Klerk (Le Clercq), de Villiers, du Plessis, Du Preez (Des Pres), du Randt (Durand), du Toit, Duvenhage(Du Vinage), Franck, Fouche, Fourie (Fleurit), Gervais, Giliomee (Guilliaume), Gous/Gouws (Gauch), Hugo, Jordaan (Jourdan), Joubert, Kriek, Labuschagne (la Buscagne), le Roux, Lombard, Malan, Malherbe, Marais, Maree, Minnaar (Mesnard), Nel (Nell),Naude', Nortje (Nortier), Pienaar (Pinard), Retief (Retif), Rossouw (Rousseau), Taljaard (Taillard), TerBlanche, Theron, Viljoen (Villion) and Visagie (Visage).
551	2365	The wine industry in South Africa owes a significant debt to the Huguenots, some of whom had vineyards in France, or were brandy distillers, and used their skills in their new home.
552	2366	Paul Revere was descended from Huguenot refugees, as was Henry Laurens, who signed the Articles of Confederation for South Carolina; Jack Jouett, who made the ride from Cuckoo Tavern to warn Thomas Jefferson and others that Tarleton and his men were on their way to arrest him for crimes against the king; Francis Marion, and a number of other leaders of the American Revolution and later statesmen.
552	2367	The last active Huguenot congregation in North America worships in Charleston, South Carolina, at a church that dates to 1844.
552	2368	The Huguenot Society of America maintains Manakin Episcopal Church in Virginia as an historic shrine with occasional services.
552	2369	The Society has chapters in numerous states, with the one in Texas being the largest.
553	2370	Some Huguenots settled in Bedfordshire, one of the main centres of the British lace industry at the time.
553	2371	Although 19th century sources have asserted that some of these refugees were lacemakers and contributed to the East Midlands lace industry, this is contentious.
553	2372	The only reference to immigrant lacemakers in this period is of twenty-five widows who settled in Dover, and there is no contemporary documentation to support there being Huguenot lacemakers in Bedfordshire.
553	2373	The implication that the style of lace known as 'Bucks Point' demonstrates a Huguenot influence, being a "combination of Mechlin patterns on Lille ground", is fallacious: what is now known as Mechlin lace did not develop until first half of the eighteenth century and lace with Mechlin patterns and Lille ground did not appear until the end of the 18th century, when it was widely copied throughout Europe.
554	2374	In Berlin, the Huguenots created two new neighbourhoods: Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt.
554	2375	By 1700, one-fifth of the city's population was French speaking.
554	2376	The Berlin Huguenots preserved the French language in their church services for nearly a century.
554	2377	They ultimately decided to switch to German in protest against the occupation of Prussia by Napoleon in 1806-07.
554	2378	Many of their descendents rose to positions of prominence.
554	2379	Several congregations were founded, such as those of Fredericia (Denmark), Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Emden.
555	2380	After this, Huguenots (with estimates ranging from 200,000 to 1,000,000) fled to surrounding Protestant countries: England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, and Prussia — whose Calvinist Great Elector Frederick William welcomed them to help rebuild his war-ravaged and underpopulated country.
555	2381	Following this exodus, Huguenots remained in large numbers in only one region of France: the rugged Cévennes region in the south.
555	2382	In the early 18th century, a regional group known as the Camisards who were Huguenots rioted against the Catholic Church in the region, burning churches and killing clergy.
555	2383	It took French troops years to hunt down and destroy all the bands of Camisards, between 1702 and 1709.
556	2384	In 1564 a group of Norman Huguenots under the leadership of Jean Ribault established the small colony of Fort Caroline on the banks of the St. Johns River in what is today Jacksonville, Florida.
556	2385	The effort was the first at any permanent European settlement in the present-day continental United States, but survived only a short time.
556	2386	A September 1565 French naval attack against the new Spanish colony at St. Augustine failed when its ships were hit by a hurricane on their way to the Spanish encampment at Fort Matanzas.
556	2387	Hundreds of French soldiers were stranded and surrendered to the numerically inferior Spanish forces led by Pedro Menendez.
556	2388	Menendez proceeded to massacre the defenseless Huguenots, after which he wiped out the Fort Caroline garrison.
557	2389	French Huguenots made two attempts to establish a haven in North America.
557	2390	In 1562, naval officer Jean Ribault led an expedition that explored Florida and the present-day Southeastern U.S., and founded the outpost of Charlesfort on Parris Island, South Carolina.
557	2391	The Wars of Religion precluded a return voyage, and the outpost was abandoned.
557	2392	In 1564, Ribault's former lieutenant René Goulaine de Laudonnière launched a second voyage to build a colony; he established Fort Caroline in what is now Jacksonville, Florida.
557	2393	War at home again precluded a resupply mission, and the colony struggled.
557	2394	In 1565 the Spanish decided to enforce their claim to La Florida, and sent Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, who established the settlement of St. Augustine near Fort Caroline.
557	2395	Menéndez' forces routed the French and executed most of the Protestant captives.
558	2396	In 1700 several hundred French Huguenots migrated from England to the colony of Virginia, where the English Crown had promised them land grants in Lower Norfolk County.
558	2397	When they arrived, colonial authorities offered them instead land 20 miles above the falls of the James River, at the abandoned Monacan village known as Manakin Town, now in Powhatan County.
558	2398	Some settlers landed in present-day Chesterfield County.
558	2399	On 12 May 1705, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act to naturalise the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown.
558	2400	Of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement, many had died; others lived outside town on farms in the English style; and others moved to different areas.
558	2401	Gradually they intermarried with their English neighbors.
558	2402	Through the 18th and 19th centuries, descendants of the French migrated west into the Piedmont, and across the Appalachian Mountains into the West of what became Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and other states.
558	2403	In the Manakintown area, the Huguenot Memorial Bridge across the James River and Huguenot Road were named in their honor, as were many local features, including several schools, including Huguenot High School.
559	2404	Some Huguenots fought in the Low Countries alongside the Dutch against Spain during the first years of the Dutch Revolt (1568–1609).
559	2405	The Dutch Republic rapidly became a destination for Huguenot exiles.
559	2406	Early ties were already visible in the "Apologie" of William the Silent, condemning the Spanish Inquisition, which was written by his court minister, the Huguenot Pierre L'Oyseleur, lord of Villiers.
559	2407	Louise de Coligny, daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, married William the Silent, leader of the Dutch (Calvinist) revolt against Spanish (Catholic) rule.
559	2408	As both spoke French in daily life, their court church in the Prinsenhof in Delft held services in French.
559	2409	The practice has continued to the present day.
559	2410	The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active Walloon churches of the Dutch Reformed Church.
559	2411	The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic's military and political leadership, the House of Orange-Nassau, which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt, helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic's colonies.
559	2412	They settled at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and New Netherland in North America.
560	2413	Both before and after the 1708 passage of the Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act, an estimated 50,000 Protestant Walloons and Huguenots fled to England, with many moving on to Ireland and elsewhere.
560	2414	In relative terms, this was one of the largest waves of immigration ever of a single ethnic community to Britain.
560	2415	Andrew Lortie (born André Lortie), a leading Huguenot theologian and writer who led the exiled community in London, became known for articulating their criticism of the Pope and the doctrine of transubstantiation during Mass.
561	2416	Following the French Crown's revocation of the Edict of Nantes, many Huguenots settled in Ireland in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, encouraged by an act of parliament for Protestants' settling in Ireland.
561	2417	Huguenot regiments fought for William of Orange in the Williamite war in Ireland, for which they were rewarded with land grants and titles, many settling in Dublin.
561	2418	Significant Huguenot settlements were in Dublin, Cork, Portarlington, Lisburn, Waterford and Youghal.
561	2419	Smaller settlements, which included Killeshandra in County Cavan, contributed to the expansion of flax cultivation and the growth of the Irish linen industry.
562	2420	Prince Louis de Condé, along with his sons Daniel and Osias,[citation needed] arranged with Count Ludwig von Nassau-Saarbrücken to establish a Huguenot community in present-day Saarland in 1604.
562	2421	The Count supported mercantilism and welcomed technically skilled immigrants into his lands, regardless of their religion.
562	2422	The Condés established a thriving glass-making works, which provided wealth to the principality for many years.
562	2423	Other founding families created enterprises based on textiles and such traditional Huguenot occupations in France.
562	2424	The community and its congregation remain active to this day, with descendants of many of the founding families still living in the region.
562	2425	Some members of this community emigrated to the United States in the 1890s.
563	2426	The bulk of Huguenot émigrés relocated to Protestant European nations such as England, Wales, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, the Dutch Republic, the Electorate of Brandenburg and Electorate of the Palatinate in the Holy Roman Empire, the Duchy of Prussia, the Channel Islands, and Ireland.
563	2427	They also spread beyond Europe to the Dutch Cape Colony in South Africa, the Dutch East Indies, the Caribbean, and several of the English colonies of North America, and Quebec, where they were accepted and allowed to worship freely.
564	2428	Some disagree with such double or triple non-French linguistic origins, arguing that for the word to have spread into common use in France, it must have originated in the French language.
564	2429	The "Hugues hypothesis" argues that the name was derived by association with Hugues Capet, king of France, who reigned long before the Reformation.
564	2430	He was regarded by the Gallicans and Protestants as a noble man who respected people's dignity and lives.
564	2431	Janet Gray and other supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name huguenote would be roughly equivalent to little Hugos, or those who want Hugo.
565	2432	Other predecessors of the Reformed church included the pro-reform and Gallican Roman Catholics, such as Jacques Lefevre (c. 1455–1536).
565	2433	The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power.
565	2434	During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the University of Paris, published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530.
565	2435	William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva.
565	2436	Jean Cauvin (John Calvin), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism.
565	2437	Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French Waldensians, then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join William Farel, Calvin and the Reformation, and Olivetan published a French Bible for them.
565	2438	The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly Calvinistic influence.
565	2439	Sometime between 1550 and 1580, members of the Reformed church in France came to be commonly known as Huguenots.
566	2440	In what became known as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 24 August – 3 October 1572, Catholics killed thousands of Huguenots in Paris.
566	2441	Similar massacres took place in other towns in the weeks following.
566	2442	The main provincial towns and cities experiencing the Massacre were Aix, Bordeaux, Bourges, Lyons, Meaux, Orleans, Rouen, Toulouse, and Troyes.
566	2443	Nearly 3,000 Protestants were slaughtered in Toulouse alone.
566	2444	The exact number of fatalities throughout the country is not known.
566	2445	On 23–24 August, between about 2,000 and 3,000 Protestants were killed in Paris and between 3,000 and 7,000 more in the French provinces.
566	2446	By 17 September, almost 25,000 Protestants had been massacred in Paris alone.
566	2447	Beyond Paris, the killings continued until 3 October.
566	2448	An amnesty granted in 1573 pardoned the perpetrators.
567	2449	Louis XIV gained the throne in 1643 and acted increasingly aggressively to force the Huguenots to convert.
567	2450	At first he sent missionaries, backed by a fund to financially reward converts to Catholicism.
567	2451	Then he imposed penalties, closed Huguenot schools and excluded them from favored professions.
567	2452	Escalating, he instituted dragonnades, which included the occupation and looting of Huguenot homes by military troops, in an effort to forcibly convert them.
567	2453	In 1685, he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, revoking the Edict of Nantes and declaring Protestantism illegal.
568	2454	New Rochelle, located in the county of Westchester on the north shore of Long Island Sound, seemed to be the great location of the Huguenots in New York.
568	2455	It is said that they landed on the coastline peninsula of Davenports Neck called "Bauffet's Point" after traveling from England where they had previously taken refuge on account of religious persecution, four years before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.
568	2456	They purchased from John Pell, Lord of Pelham Manor, a tract of land consisting of six thousand one hundred acres with the help of Jacob Leisler.
568	2457	It was named New Rochelle after La Rochelle, their former strong-hold in France.
568	2458	A small wooden church was first erected in the community, followed by a second church that built of stone.
568	2459	Previous to the erection of it, the strong men would often walk twenty-three miles on Saturday evening, the distance by the road from New Rochelle to New York, to attend the Sunday service.
568	2460	The church was eventually replaced by a third, Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church, which contains heirlooms including the original bell from the French Huguenot Church "Eglise du St. Esperit" on Pine Street in New York City, which is preserved as a relic in the tower room.
568	2461	The Huguenot cemetery, or "Huguenot Burial Ground", has since been recognized as a historic cemetery that is the final resting place for a wide range of the Huguenot founders, early settlers and prominent citizens dating back more than three centuries.
569	2462	Most of the Huguenot congregations (or individuals) in North America eventually affiliated with other Protestant denominations with more numerous members.
569	2463	The Huguenots adapted quickly and often married outside their immediate French communities, which led to their assimilation.
569	2464	Their descendants in many families continued to use French first names and surnames for their children well into the nineteenth century.
569	2465	Assimilated, the French made numerous contributions to United States economic life, especially as merchants and artisans in the late Colonial and early Federal periods.
569	2466	du Pont, a former student of Lavoisier, established the Eleutherian gunpowder mills.
570	2467	One of the most prominent Huguenot refugees in the Netherlands was Pierre Bayle.
570	2468	He started teaching in Rotterdam, where he finished writing and publishing his multi-volume masterpiece, Historical and Critical Dictionary.
570	2469	It became one of the 100 foundational texts of the US Library of Congress.
570	2470	Some Huguenot descendants in the Netherlands may be noted by French family names, although they typically use Dutch given names.
570	2471	Due to the Huguenots' early ties with the leadership of the Dutch Revolt and their own participation, some of the Dutch patriciate are of part-Huguenot descent.
570	2472	Some Huguenot families have kept alive various traditions, such as the celebration and feast of their patron Saint Nicolas, similar to the Dutch Sint Nicolaas (Sinterklaas) feast.
571	2473	The French Protestant Church of London was established by Royal Charter in 1550.
571	2474	It is now located at Soho Square.
571	2475	Huguenot refugees flocked to Shoreditch, London.
571	2476	They established a major weaving industry in and around Spitalfields (see Petticoat Lane and the Tenterground) in East London.
571	2477	In Wandsworth, their gardening skills benefited the Battersea market gardens.
571	2478	The Old Truman Brewery, then known as the Black Eagle Brewery, was founded in 1724.
571	2479	The flight of Huguenot refugees from Tours, France drew off most of the workers of its great silk mills which they had built.
571	2480	[citation needed] Some of these immigrants moved to Norwich, which had accommodated an earlier settlement of Walloon weavers.
571	2481	The French added to the existing immigrant population, then comprising about a third of the population of the city.
572	2482	Around 1685, Huguenot refugees found a safe haven in the Lutheran and Reformed states in Germany and Scandinavia.
572	2483	Nearly 50,000 Huguenots established themselves in Germany, 20,000 of whom were welcomed in Brandenburg-Prussia, where they were granted special privileges (Edict of Potsdam) and churches in which to worship (such as the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Angermünde) by Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia.
572	2484	The Huguenots furnished two new regiments of his army: the Altpreußische Infantry Regiments No.
572	2485	13 (Regiment on foot Varenne) and 15 (Regiment on foot Wylich).
572	2486	Another 4,000 Huguenots settled in the German territories of Baden, Franconia (Principality of Bayreuth, Principality of Ansbach), Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, Duchy of Württemberg, in the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts, in the Palatinate and Palatinate-Zweibrücken, in the Rhine-Main-Area (Frankfurt), in modern-day Saarland; and 1,500 found refuge in Hamburg, Bremen and Lower Saxony.
572	2487	Three hundred refugees were granted asylum at the court of George William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Celle.
573	2488	Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, invited Huguenots to settle in his realms, and a number of their descendants rose to positions of prominence in Prussia.
573	2489	Several prominent German military, cultural, and political figures were ethnic Huguenot, including poet Theodor Fontane, General Hermann von François, the hero of the First World War Battle of Tannenberg, Luftwaffe General and fighter ace Adolf Galland, Luftwaffe flying ace Hans-Joachim Marseille, and famed U-boat captain Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière.
573	2490	The last Prime Minister of the (East) German Democratic Republic, Lothar de Maizière, is also a descendant of a Huguenot family, as is the German Federal Minister of the Interior, Thomas de Maizière.
574	2491	Steam engines are external combustion engines, where the working fluid is separate from the combustion products.
574	2492	Non-combustion heat sources such as solar power, nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used.
574	2493	The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle.
574	2494	In the cycle, water is heated and transforms into steam within a boiler operating at a high pressure.
574	2495	When expanded through pistons or turbines, mechanical work is done.
574	2496	The reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler.
575	2497	The first commercially successful true engine, in that it could generate power and transmit it to a machine, was the atmospheric engine, invented by Thomas Newcomen around 1712.
575	2498	It was an improvement over Savery's steam pump, using a piston as proposed by Papin.
575	2499	Newcomen's engine was relatively inefficient, and in most cases was used for pumping water.
575	2500	It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder.
575	2501	It was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible, and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable "head".
575	2502	Water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel.
576	2503	The first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick in the United Kingdom and, on 21 February 1804, the world's first railway journey took place as Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway from the Pen-y-darren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon in south Wales.
576	2504	The design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency.
576	2505	Trevithick visited the Newcastle area later in 1804 and the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation and development of steam locomotives.
577	2506	The Rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water, so that they may be run continuously.
577	2507	Utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage centrifugal pumps; however, other types are used.
577	2508	Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an injector, which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler.
577	2509	Injectors became popular in the 1850s but are no longer widely used, except in applications such as steam locomotives.
578	2510	It is a logical extension of the compound engine (described above) to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency.
578	2511	The result is the multiple expansion engine.
578	2512	Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively.
578	2513	These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter.
578	2514	These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage.
578	2515	As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage.
578	2516	Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used.
578	2517	In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing 'system' was used on some marine triple expansion engines.
578	2518	Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine.
578	2519	This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration.
578	2520	This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free turbine engine.
579	2521	In the 1840s and 50s, there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate, variable cutoff expansion valve riding on the back of the main slide valve; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff.
579	2522	The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated.
579	2523	The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred.
579	2524	This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions.
579	2525	Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.
580	2526	Lead fusible plugs may be present in the crown of the boiler's firebox.
580	2527	If the water level drops, such that the temperature of the firebox crown increases significantly, the lead melts and the steam escapes, warning the operators, who may then manually suppress the fire.
580	2528	Except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire.
580	2529	The plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly, depressurizing the boiler.
580	2530	If they were any larger, the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew.
581	2531	In 1781 James Watt patented a steam engine that produced continuous rotary motion.
581	2532	Watt's ten-horsepower engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery to be powered.
581	2533	The engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood fuel could be obtained.
581	2534	By 1883, engines that could provide 10,000 hp had become feasible.
581	2535	The stationary steam engine was a key component of the Industrial Revolution, allowing factories to locate where water power was unavailable.
581	2536	The atmospheric engines of Newcomen and Watt were large compared to the amount of power they produced, but high pressure steam engines were light enough to be applied to vehicles such as traction engines and the railway locomotives.
582	2537	The history of the steam engine stretches back as far as the first century AD; the first recorded rudimentary steam engine being the aeolipile described by Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria.
582	2538	In the following centuries, the few steam-powered "engines" known were, like the aeolipile, essentially experimental devices used by inventors to demonstrate the properties of steam.
582	2539	A rudimentary steam turbine device was described by Taqi al-Din in 1551 and by Giovanni Branca in 1629.
582	2540	Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont received patents in 1606 for fifty steam powered inventions, including a water pump for draining inundated mines.
582	2541	Denis Papin, a Huguenot refugee, did some useful work on the steam digester in 1679, and first used a piston to raise weights in 1690.
583	2542	Near the end of the 19th century compound engines came into widespread use.
583	2543	Compound engines exhausted steam in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency.
583	2544	These stages were called expansions, with double and triple expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.
583	2545	Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines, with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine.
584	2546	The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam turbines starting in the late part of the 19th century.
584	2547	Steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines (for outputs above several hundred horsepower), have fewer moving parts, and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means.
584	2548	Steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century, where their efficiency, higher speed appropriate to generator service, and smooth rotation were advantages.
584	2549	Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines.
584	2550	In the United States 90% of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources.
584	2551	Steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century.
585	2552	The heat required for boiling the water and supplying the steam can be derived from various sources, most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space (called variously combustion chamber, firebox).
585	2553	In some cases the heat source is a nuclear reactor, geothermal energy, solar energy or waste heat from an internal combustion engine or industrial process.
585	2554	In the case of model or toy steam engines, the heat source can be an electric heating element.
586	2555	The most useful instrument for analyzing the performance of steam engines is the steam engine indicator.
586	2556	Early versions were in use by 1851, but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer Charles Porter by Charles Richard and exhibited at London Exhibition in 1862.
586	2557	The steam engine indicator traces on paper the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle, which can be used to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower.
586	2558	It was routinely used by engineers, mechanics and insurance inspectors.
586	2559	The engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines.
586	2560	See image of indicator diagram below (in Types of motor units section).
587	2561	With two-cylinder compounds used in railway work, the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90° out of phase with each other (quartered).
587	2562	When the double expansion group is duplicated, producing a 4-cylinder compound, the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180°, the groups being set at 90° to each other.
587	2563	In one case (the first type of Vauclain compound), the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common crosshead and crank, again set at 90° as for a two-cylinder engine.
587	2564	With the 3-cylinder compound arrangement, the LP cranks were either set at 90° with the HP one at 135° to the other two, or in some cases all three cranks were set at 120°.
588	2565	In most reciprocating piston engines, the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke (counterflow), entering and exhausting from the cylinder by the same port.
588	2566	The complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes; the cycle also comprises four events – admission, expansion, exhaust, compression.
588	2567	These events are controlled by valves often working inside a steam chest adjacent to the cylinder; the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ports communicating with the cylinder end(s) and are driven by valve gear, of which there are many types.
589	2568	Uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle where, during each stroke, the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam, whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy in restoring working temperature.
589	2569	The aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction.
589	2570	By this means, the simple-expansion uniflow engine gives efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems with the added advantage of superior part-load performance, and comparable efficiency to turbines for smaller engines below one thousand horsepower.
589	2571	However, the thermal expansion gradient uniflow engines produce along the cylinder wall gives practical difficulties.
589	2572	The Quasiturbine is a uniflow rotary steam engine where steam intakes in hot areas, while exhausting in cold areas.
590	2573	An oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam into and out of the cylinder.
590	2574	Instead of valves, the entire cylinder rocks, or oscillates, such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting (trunnion).
590	2575	These engines are mainly used in toys and models, because of their simplicity, but have also been used in full size working engines, mainly on ships where their compactness is valued.
591	2576	The working fluid in a Rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system, where the working fluid is recycled continuously, or may be an "open loop" system, where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere, and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is supplied.
591	2577	Normally water is the fluid of choice due to its favourable properties, such as non-toxic and unreactive chemistry, abundance, low cost, and its thermodynamic properties.
591	2578	Mercury is the working fluid in the mercury vapor turbine.
591	2579	Low boiling hydrocarbons can be used in a binary cycle.
592	2580	The efficiency of a Rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid.
592	2581	Without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid, the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small; in steam turbines, turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 °C (the creep limit of stainless steel) and condenser temperatures are around 30 °C.
592	2582	This gives a theoretical Carnot efficiency of about 63% compared with an actual efficiency of 42% for a modern coal-fired power station.
592	2583	This low turbine entry temperature (compared with a gas turbine) is why the Rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in combined-cycle gas turbine power stations.
593	2584	Steam engines can be said to have been the moving force behind the Industrial Revolution and saw widespread commercial use driving machinery in factories, mills and mines; powering pumping stations; and propelling transport appliances such as railway locomotives, ships, steamboats and road vehicles.
593	2585	Their use in agriculture led to an increase in the land available for cultivation.
593	2586	There have at one time or another been steam-powered farm tractors, motorcycles (without much success) and even automobiles as the Stanley Steamer.
594	2587	Trevithick continued his own experiments using a trio of locomotives, concluding with the Catch Me Who Can in 1808.
594	2588	Only four years later, the successful twin-cylinder locomotive Salamanca by Matthew Murray was used by the edge railed rack and pinion Middleton Railway.
594	2589	In 1825 George Stephenson built the Locomotion for the Stockton and Darlington Railway.
594	2590	This was the first public steam railway in the world and then in 1829, he built The Rocket which was entered in and won the Rainhill Trials.
594	2591	The Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened in 1830 making exclusive use of steam power for both passenger and freight trains.
595	2592	A method to lessen the magnitude of this heating and cooling was invented in 1804 by British engineer Arthur Woolf, who patented his Woolf high-pressure compound engine in 1805.
595	2593	In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders.
595	2594	The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each.
595	2595	This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine.
595	2596	By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced.
595	2597	To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume.
595	2598	Therefore, the bore, and often the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders.
596	2599	The main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation (in the 1990s about 90% of the world's electric production was by use of steam turbines) however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80% regime for steam turbines.
596	2600	In electricity production, the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators, which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines.
596	2601	In marine service, (pioneered on the Turbinia), steam turbines with reduction gearing (although the Turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century, being more efficient (and requiring far less maintenance) than reciprocating steam engines.
596	2602	In recent decades, reciprocating Diesel engines, and gas turbines, have almost entirely supplanted steam propulsion for marine applications.
597	2603	The Rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine.
597	2604	The cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production, and utilizes the phase change of water (boiling water producing steam, condensing exhaust steam, producing liquid water)) to provide a practical heat/power conversion system.
597	2605	The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser.
597	2606	The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications.
597	2607	In the 1990s, Rankine steam cycles generated about 90% of all electric power used throughout the world, including virtually all solar, biomass, coal and nuclear power plants.
597	2608	It is named after William John Macquorn Rankine, a Scottish polymath.
598	2609	The historical measure of a steam engine's energy efficiency was its "duty".
598	2610	The concept of duty was first introduced by Watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier Newcomen designs.
598	2611	Duty is the number of foot-pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel (94 pounds) of coal.
598	2612	The best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million, but most were closer to 5 million.
598	2613	Watt's original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million, but averaged about 17.
598	2614	This was a three-fold improvement over the average Newcomen design.
598	2615	Early Watt engines equipped with high-pressure steam improved this to 65 million.
599	2616	Reciprocating piston type steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines in commercial usage, and the ascendancy of steam turbines in power generation.
599	2617	Considering that the great majority of worldwide electric generation is produced by turbine type steam engines, the "steam age" is continuing with energy levels far beyond those of the turn of the 19th century.
600	2618	The first commercial steam-powered device was a water pump, developed in 1698 by Thomas Savery.
600	2619	It used condensing steam to create a vacuum which was used to raise water from below, then it used steam pressure to raise it higher.
600	2620	Small engines were effective though larger models were problematic.
600	2621	They proved only to have a limited lift height and were prone to boiler explosions.
600	2622	It received some use in mines, pumping stations and for supplying water wheels used to power textile machinery.
600	2623	An attractive feature of the Savery engine was its low cost.
600	2624	Bento de Moura Portugal introduced an ingenious improvement of Savery's construction "to render it capable of working itself", as described by John Smeaton in the Philosophical Transactions published in 1751.
600	2625	It continued to be manufactured until the late 18th century.
600	2626	One engine was still known to be operating in 1820.
601	2627	Around 1800 Richard Trevithick and, separately, Oliver Evans in 1801 introduced engines using high-pressure steam; Trevithick obtained his high-pressure engine patent in 1802.
601	2628	These were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications.
601	2629	Thereafter, technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques (partly brought about by the adoption of the steam engine as a power source) resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller, faster, or more powerful, depending on the intended application.
602	2630	Although the reciprocating steam engine is no longer in widespread commercial use, various companies are exploring or exploiting the potential of the engine as an alternative to internal combustion engines.
602	2631	The company Energiprojekt AB in Sweden has made progress in using modern materials for harnessing the power of steam.
602	2632	The efficiency of Energiprojekt's steam engine reaches some 27-30% on high-pressure engines.
602	2633	It is a single-step, 5-cylinder engine (no compound) with superheated steam and consumes approx.
602	2634	4 kg (8.8 lb) of steam per kWh.
603	2635	Where CHP is not used, steam turbines in power stations use surface condensers as a cold sink.
603	2636	The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal.
603	2637	The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump.
603	2638	A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly.
603	2639	Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler.
603	2640	Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air.
603	2641	Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than "once-through" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.
604	2642	The centrifugal governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after Watt’s partner Boulton saw one at a flour mill Boulton & Watt were building.
604	2643	The governor could not actually hold a set speed, because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes.
604	2644	The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler.
604	2645	Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change.
604	2646	As a consequence, engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.
604	2647	The governor was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off, good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century.
605	2648	The adoption of compounding was common for industrial units, for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880; it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated.
605	2649	This is partly due to the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the loading gauge (particularly in Britain, where compounding was never common and not employed after 1930).
605	2650	However, although never in the majority, it was popular in many other countries.
606	2651	The simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction.
606	2652	Most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually "shortening the cutoff" or rather, shortening the admission event; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period.
606	2653	However, as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows, a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant; if the exhaust event is too brief, the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder, choking it and giving excessive compression ("kick back").
607	2654	Using boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back over 2000 years, but early devices were not practical.
607	2655	The Spanish inventor Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont obtained the first patent for a steam engine in 1606.
607	2656	In 1698 Thomas Savery patented a steam pump that used steam in direct contact with the water being pumped.
607	2657	Savery's steam pump used condensing steam to create a vacuum and draw water into a chamber, and then applied pressurized steam to further pump the water.
607	2658	Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine was the first commercial true steam engine using a piston, and was used in 1712 for pumping in a mine.
608	2659	A steam turbine consists of one or more rotors (rotating discs) mounted on a drive shaft, alternating with a series of stators (static discs) fixed to the turbine casing.
608	2660	The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge.
608	2661	Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion.
608	2662	The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage.
608	2663	A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum.
608	2664	The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages.
608	2665	Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller.
608	2666	In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing.
608	2667	Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems.
608	2668	In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM.
608	2669	A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction.
608	2670	Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.
609	2671	The weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines.
609	2672	For mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors.
609	2673	However, most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant, so that indirectly the world's industry is still dependent on steam power.
609	2674	Recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover.
609	2675	This is becoming known as the Advanced Steam movement.
610	2676	It is possible to use a mechanism based on a pistonless rotary engine such as the Wankel engine in place of the cylinders and valve gear of a conventional reciprocating steam engine.
610	2677	Many such engines have been designed, from the time of James Watt to the present day, but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production; see link at bottom of article for more details.
610	2678	The major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steam-tight in the face of wear and thermal expansion; the resulting leakage made them very inefficient.
610	2679	Lack of expansive working, or any means of control of the cutoff is also a serious problem with many such designs.
611	2680	The next major step occurred when James Watt developed (1763–1775) an improved version of Newcomen's engine, with a separate condenser.
611	2681	Boulton and Watt's early engines used half as much coal as John Smeaton's improved version of Newcomen's.
611	2682	Newcomen's and Watt's early engines were "atmospheric".
611	2683	They were powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam, instead of the pressure of expanding steam.
611	2684	The engine cylinders had to be large because the only usable force acting on them was due to atmospheric pressure.
612	2685	Steam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high; one may be adjusted by the user, the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe.
612	2686	Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler.
612	2687	One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure.
612	2688	Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine.
612	2689	The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken.
613	2690	The acme of the horizontal engine was the Corliss steam engine, patented in 1849, which was a four-valve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff.
613	2691	When Corliss was given the Rumford medal the committee said that "no one invention since Watt's time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine".
613	2692	In addition to using 30% less steam, it provided more uniform speed due to variable steam cut off, making it well suited to manufacturing, especially cotton spinning.
614	2693	The steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory; however, the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam.
614	2694	The experimental measurements made by Watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser.
614	2695	Watt independently discovered latent heat, which was confirmed by the original discoverer Joseph Black, who also advised Watt on experimental procedures.
614	2696	Watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure.
614	2697	Otherwise, the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature.
614	2698	The thermodynamic concepts of the Rankine cycle did give engineers the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine.
615	2699	One of the principal advantages the Rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump, the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point.
615	2700	By condensing the fluid, the work required by the pump consumes only 1% to 3% of the turbine power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle.
615	2701	The benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature.
615	2702	Gas turbines, for instance, have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500 °C.
615	2703	Nonetheless, the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas turbines are fairly well matched.
616	2704	Other components are often present; pumps (such as an injector) to supply water to the boiler during operation, condensers to recirculate the water and recover the latent heat of vaporisation, and superheaters to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapour point, and various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes.
616	2705	When coal is used, a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor may be included to move the fuel from a supply bin (bunker) to the firebox.
617	2706	Land-based steam engines could exhaust much of their steam, as feed water was usually readily available.
617	2707	Prior to and during World War I, the expansion engine dominated marine applications where high vessel speed was not essential.
617	2708	It was however superseded by the British invention steam turbine where speed was required, for instance in warships, such as the dreadnought battleships, and ocean liners.
617	2709	HMS Dreadnought of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbine.
618	2710	Virtually all nuclear power plants generate electricity by heating water to provide steam that drives a turbine connected to an electrical generator.
618	2711	Nuclear-powered ships and submarines either use a steam turbine directly for main propulsion, with generators providing auxiliary power, or else employ turbo-electric transmission, where the steam drives a turbo generator set with propulsion provided by electric motors.
618	2712	A limited number of steam turbine railroad locomotives were manufactured.
618	2713	Some non-condensing direct-drive locomotives did meet with some success for long haul freight operations in Sweden and for express passenger work in Britain, but were not repeated.
618	2714	Elsewhere, notably in the U.S.A., more advanced designs with electric transmission were built experimentally, but not reproduced.
618	2715	It was found that steam turbines were not ideally suited to the railroad environment and these locomotives failed to oust the classic reciprocating steam unit in the way that modern diesel and electric traction has done.
619	2716	The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because, when an efficient turbine is used, the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle.
619	2717	The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle.
619	2718	In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas.
619	2719	Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle).
619	2720	The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.
620	2721	Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8.
620	2722	It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds (notably oxides) with most elements.
620	2723	By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium.
620	2724	At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O\n2.
620	2725	Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere.
620	2726	However, monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend, because of fossil-fuel burning.
620	2727	Oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide, making up almost half of the crust's mass.
621	2728	Many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and fats, contain oxygen, as do the major inorganic compounds that are constituents of animal shells, teeth, and bone.
621	2729	Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as it is a part of water, the major constituent of lifeforms.
621	2730	Oxygen is used in cellular respiration and released by photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water.
621	2731	It is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms.
621	2732	Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O\n3), strongly absorbs UVB radiation and consequently the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation, but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by-product of smog.
621	2733	At even higher low earth orbit altitudes, sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause erosion for spacecraft.
622	2734	In the late 17th century, Robert Boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion.
622	2735	English chemist John Mayow (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus.
622	2736	In one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects.
622	2737	From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.
623	2738	In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide (HgO) inside a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named "dephlogisticated air".
623	2739	He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it.
623	2740	After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: "The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards."
623	2741	Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled "An Account of Further Discoveries in Air" which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air.
623	2742	Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.
624	2743	One of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century BCE Greek writer on mechanics, Philo of Byzantium.
624	2744	In his work Pneumatica, Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck.
624	2745	Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass.
624	2746	Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration.
625	2747	Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion.
625	2748	Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, is needed to trigger combustion.
625	2749	Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel, but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion.
625	2750	Combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential, such as peroxides, chlorates, nitrates, perchlorates, and dichromates because they can donate oxygen to a fire.
626	2751	Concentrated O\n2 will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically.
626	2752	Steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel; and therefore the design and manufacture of O\n2 systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized.
626	2753	The fire that killed the Apollo 1 crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure O\n2 but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure, instead of the 1⁄3 normal pressure that would be used in a mission.
627	2754	Oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO\n2).
627	2755	The Earth's crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon (silica SiO\n2, as found in granite and quartz), aluminium (aluminium oxide Al\n2O\n3, in bauxite and corundum), iron (iron(III) oxide Fe\n2O\n3, in hematite and rust), and calcium carbonate (in limestone).
627	2756	The rest of the Earth's crust is also made of oxygen compounds, in particular various complex silicates (in silicate minerals).
627	2757	The Earth's mantle, of much larger mass than the crust, is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron.
628	2758	John Dalton's original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another.
628	2759	For example, Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, giving the atomic mass of oxygen as 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16.
628	2760	In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called Avogadro's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules.
629	2761	Highly combustible materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston; whereas non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little.
629	2762	Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.
629	2763	The fact that a substance like wood gains overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products.
629	2764	Indeed, one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals, too, gain weight in rusting (when they were supposedly losing phlogiston).
630	2765	In this dioxygen, the two oxygen atoms are chemically bonded to each other.
630	2766	The bond can be variously described based on level of theory, but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms, the filling of which results in a bond order of two.
630	2767	More specifically, the double bond is the result of sequential, low-to-high energy, or Aufbau, filling of orbitals, and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons, after sequential filling of the low σ and σ* orbitals; σ overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the O-O molecular axis and π overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the O-O molecular axis, and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest π and π* orbitals.
631	2768	Oxygen was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774, but Priestley is often given priority because his work was published first.
631	2769	The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion.
631	2770	Its name derives from the Greek roots ὀξύς oxys, "acid", literally "sharp", referring to the sour taste of acids and -γενής -genes, "producer", literally "begetter", because at the time of naming, it was mistakenly thought that all acids required oxygen in their composition.
631	2771	Common uses of oxygen includes the production cycle of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, in oxygen therapy and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.
632	2772	This combination of cancellations and σ and π overlaps results in dioxygen's double bond character and reactivity, and a triplet electronic ground state.
632	2773	An electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as found in dioxygen (see the filled π* orbitals in the diagram), orbitals that are of equal energy—i.e., degenerate—is a configuration termed a spin triplet state.
632	2774	Hence, the ground state of the O\n2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen.
632	2775	[b] The highest energy, partially filled orbitals are antibonding, and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two.
632	2776	Because of its unpaired electrons, triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins; this prevents spontaneous combustion.
633	2777	In one experiment, Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container.
633	2778	He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container, which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed.
633	2779	He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in.
633	2780	This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book Sur la combustion en général, which was published in 1777.
633	2781	In that work, he proved that air is a mixture of two gases; 'vital air', which is essential to combustion and respiration, and azote (Gk.
633	2782	ἄζωτον "lifeless"), which did not support either.
633	2783	Azote later became nitrogen in English, although it has kept the name in French and several other European languages.
634	2784	Trioxygen (O\n3) is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue.
634	2785	Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when O\n2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O\n2 by ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
634	2786	Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum, the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet.
634	2787	Near the Earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust.
634	2788	The metastable molecule tetraoxygen (O\n4) was discovered in 2001, and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen.
634	2789	It was proven in 2006 that this phase, created by pressurizing O\n2 to 20 GPa, is in fact a rhombohedral O\n8 cluster.
634	2790	This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O\n2 or O\n3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel.
634	2791	A metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 GPa and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures, this phase becomes superconducting.
635	2792	The common allotrope of elemental oxygen on Earth is called dioxygen, O\n2.
635	2793	It is the form that is a major part of the Earth's atmosphere (see Occurrence).
635	2794	O2 has a bond length of 121 pm and a bond energy of 498 kJ·mol−1, which is smaller than the energy of other double bonds or pairs of single bonds in the biosphere and responsible for the exothermic reaction of O2 with any organic molecule.
635	2795	Due to its energy content, O2 is used by complex forms of life, such as animals, in cellular respiration (see Biological role).
635	2796	Other aspects of O\n2 are covered in the remainder of this article.
636	2797	In 1891 Scottish chemist James Dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen to study.
636	2798	The first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by German engineer Carl von Linde and British engineer William Hampson.
636	2799	Both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then distilled the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them.
636	2800	Later, in 1901, oxyacetylene welding was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of acetylene and compressed O\n2.
636	2801	This method of welding and cutting metal later became common.
637	2802	Oxygen is more soluble in water than nitrogen is.
637	2803	Water in equilibrium with air contains approximately 1 molecule of dissolved O\n2 for every 2 molecules of N\n2, compared to an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1:4.
637	2804	The solubility of oxygen in water is temperature-dependent, and about twice as much (14.6 mg·L−1) dissolves at 0 °C than at 20 °C (7.6 mg·L−1).
637	2805	At 25 °C and 1 standard atmosphere (101.3 kPa) of air, freshwater contains about 6.04 milliliters (mL) of oxygen per liter, whereas seawater contains about 4.95 mL per liter.
637	2806	At 5 °C the solubility increases to 9.0 mL (50% more than at 25 °C) per liter for water and 7.2 mL (45% more) per liter for sea water.
638	2807	Oxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the Earth's biosphere, air, sea and land.
638	2808	Oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium.
638	2809	About 0.9% of the Sun's mass is oxygen.
638	2810	Oxygen constitutes 49.2% of the Earth's crust by mass and is the major component of the world's oceans (88.8% by mass).
638	2811	Oxygen gas is the second most common component of the Earth's atmosphere, taking up 20.8% of its volume and 23.1% of its mass (some 1015 tonnes).
638	2812	[d] Earth is unusual among the planets of the Solar System in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere: Mars (with 0.1% O\n2 by volume) and Venus have far lower concentrations.
638	2813	The O\n2 surrounding these other planets is produced solely by ultraviolet radiation impacting oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon dioxide.
639	2814	By the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied, and its components isolated, by compressing and cooling it.
639	2815	Using a cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it.
639	2816	He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen.
639	2817	Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen.
639	2818	Only a few drops of the liquid were produced in either case so no meaningful analysis could be conducted.
639	2819	Oxygen was liquified in stable state for the first time on March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University, Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski.
640	2820	Planetary geologists have measured different abundances of oxygen isotopes in samples from the Earth, the Moon, Mars, and meteorites, but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the Sun, believed to be the same as those of the primordial solar nebula.
640	2821	Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth.
640	2822	The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth.
641	2823	Singlet oxygen is a name given to several higher-energy species of molecular O\n2 in which all the electron spins are paired.
641	2824	It is much more reactive towards common organic molecules than is molecular oxygen per se.
641	2825	In nature, singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis, using the energy of sunlight.
641	2826	It is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength, and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen.
641	2827	Carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms (and possibly also in animals) play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues.
642	2828	Paleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine what the climate was like millions of years ago (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle).
642	2829	Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18; this disparity increases at lower temperatures.
642	2830	During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18.
642	2831	Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate.
642	2832	Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples that are up to several hundreds of thousands of years old.
643	2833	Oxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760 nm.
643	2834	Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform.
643	2835	This approach exploits the fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker.
643	2836	The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.
644	2837	In the triplet form, O\n2 molecules are paramagnetic.
644	2838	That is, they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field, because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule, and the negative exchange energy between neighboring O\n2 molecules.
644	2839	Liquid oxygen is attracted to a magnet to a sufficient extent that, in laboratory demonstrations, a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet.
645	2840	Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide ion (O−\n2) and hydrogen peroxide (H\n2O\n2), are dangerous by-products of oxygen use in organisms.
645	2841	Parts of the immune system of higher organisms create peroxide, superoxide, and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes.
645	2842	Reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack.
645	2843	Oxygen is toxic to obligately anaerobic organisms, which were the dominant form of early life on Earth until O\n2 began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event, about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms.
646	2844	Oxygen condenses at 90.20 K (−182.95 °C, −297.31 °F), and freezes at 54.36 K (−218.79 °C, −361.82 °F).
646	2845	Both liquid and solid O\n2 are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red (in contrast with the blue color of the sky, which is due to Rayleigh scattering of blue light).
646	2846	High-purity liquid O\n2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air.
646	2847	Liquid oxygen may also be produced by condensation out of air, using liquid nitrogen as a coolant.
646	2848	It is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials.
647	2849	Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies.
647	2850	The increased solubility of O\n2 at lower temperatures (see Physical properties) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content.
647	2851	Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of O\n2 in eutrophic water bodies.
647	2852	Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water's biochemical oxygen demand, or the amount of O\n2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration.
648	2853	Free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in Earth's atmosphere before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years ago.
648	2854	Free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago).
648	2855	For the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations.
648	2856	When such oxygen sinks became saturated, free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3–2.7 billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7 billion years ago.
649	2857	The unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of the oxygen cycle.
649	2858	This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere.
649	2859	The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere.
649	2860	Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration and decay remove it from the atmosphere.
649	2861	In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate of roughly 1/2000th of the entire atmospheric oxygen per year.
650	2862	The other major method of producing O\n2 gas involves passing a stream of clean, dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves, which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90% to 93% O\n2.
650	2863	Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it, in the reverse direction of flow.
650	2864	After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline.
650	2865	This is known as pressure swing adsorption.
650	2866	Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies (see also the related vacuum swing adsorption).
651	2867	Oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen.
651	2868	DC electricity must be used: if AC is used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1.
651	2869	Contrary to popular belief, the 2:1 ratio observed in the DC electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is H2O unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves.
651	2870	A similar method is the electrocatalytic O\n2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids.
651	2871	Chemical catalysts can be used as well, such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines, and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies.
651	2872	Another air separation technology involves forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxide by either high pressure or an electric current, to produce nearly pure O\n2 gas.
652	2873	Oxygen, as a supposed mild euphoric, has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars and in sports.
652	2874	Oxygen bars are establishments, found in Japan, California, and Las Vegas, Nevada since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal O\n2 exposure for a fee.
652	2875	Professional athletes, especially in American football, also sometimes go off field between plays to wear oxygen masks in order to get a "boost" in performance.
652	2876	The pharmacological effect is doubtful; a placebo effect is a more likely explanation.
652	2877	Available studies support a performance boost from enriched O\n2 mixtures only if they are breathed during aerobic exercise.
653	2878	Hyperbaric (high-pressure) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of O\n2 around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff.
653	2879	Carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, and decompression sickness (the 'bends') are sometimes treated using these devices.
653	2880	Increased O\n2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin.
653	2881	Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them.
653	2882	Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood.
653	2883	Increasing the pressure of O\n2 as soon as possible is part of the treatment.
654	2884	Uptake of O\n2 from the air is the essential purpose of respiration, so oxygen supplementation is used in medicine.
654	2885	Treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient's blood, but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs, easing work load on the heart.
654	2886	Oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema, pneumonia, some heart disorders (congestive heart failure), some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure, and any disease that impairs the body's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen.
655	2887	Due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides.
655	2888	The surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion.
655	2889	Many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds, with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show.
655	2890	For example, the mineral FeO (wüstite) is written as Fe\n1 − xO, where x is usually around 0.05.
656	2891	People who climb mountains or fly in non-pressurized fixed-wing aircraft sometimes have supplemental O\n2 supplies.
656	2892	[h] Passengers traveling in (pressurized) commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of O\n2 automatically supplied to them in case of cabin depressurization.
656	2893	Sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat, causing oxygen masks to drop.
656	2894	Pulling on the masks "to start the flow of oxygen" as cabin safety instructions dictate, forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister.
656	2895	A steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction.
657	2896	Oxygen storage methods include high pressure oxygen tanks, cryogenics and chemical compounds.
657	2897	For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 °C (68 °F).
657	2898	Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas.
657	2899	Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building.
657	2900	Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting.
658	2901	Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where "R" is an organic group): alcohols (R-OH); ethers (R-O-R); ketones (R-CO-R); aldehydes (R-CO-H); carboxylic acids (R-COOH); esters (R-COO-R); acid anhydrides (R-CO-O-CO-R); and amides (R-C(O)-NR\n2).
658	2902	There are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen, including: acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, furan, THF, diethyl ether, dioxane, ethyl acetate, DMF, DMSO, acetic acid, and formic acid.
658	2903	Acetone ((CH\n3)\n2CO) and phenol (C\n6H\n5OH) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances.
658	2904	Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: glycerol, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, citric acid, acetic anhydride, and acetamide.
658	2905	Epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms.
659	2906	The element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important to (or generated by) life.
659	2907	Only a few common complex biomolecules, such as squalene and the carotenes, contain no oxygen.
659	2908	Of the organic compounds with biological relevance, carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen.
659	2909	All fats, fatty acids, amino acids, and proteins contain oxygen (due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these acids and their ester residues).
659	2910	Oxygen also occurs in phosphate (PO3−\n4) groups in the biologically important energy-carrying molecules ATP and ADP, in the backbone and the purines (except adenine) and pyrimidines of RNA and DNA, and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite.
660	2911	Oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving.
660	2912	Prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an O\n2 partial pressure more than 60 kPa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis.
660	2913	Exposure to a O\n2 partial pressures greater than 160 kPa (about 1.6 atm) may lead to convulsions (normally fatal for divers).
660	2914	Acute oxygen toxicity (causing seizures, its most feared effect for divers) can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21% O\n2 at 66 m or more of depth; the same thing can occur by breathing 100% O\n2 at only 6 m.
661	2915	Breathing pure O\n2 in space applications, such as in some modern space suits, or in early spacecraft such as Apollo, causes no damage due to the low total pressures used.
661	2916	In the case of spacesuits, the O\n2 partial pressure in the breathing gas is, in general, about 30 kPa (1.4 times normal), and the resulting O\n2 partial pressure in the astronaut's arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level O\n2 partial pressure (for more information on this, see space suit and arterial blood gas).
662	2917	Oxygen gas (O\n2) can be toxic at elevated partial pressures, leading to convulsions and other health problems.
662	2918	[j] Oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals (kPa), equal to about 50% oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times the normal sea-level O\n2 partial pressure of about 21 kPa.
662	2919	This is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators, since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30%–50% O\n2 by volume (about 30 kPa at standard pressure).
662	2920	(although this figure also is subject to wide variation, depending on type of mask).
663	2921	The 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 when the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, consisting of the Arab members of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) proclaimed an oil embargo.
663	2922	By the end of the embargo in March 1974, the price of oil had risen from US$3 per barrel to nearly $12 globally; US prices were significantly higher.
663	2923	The embargo caused an oil crisis, or "shock", with many short- and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy.
663	2924	It was later called the "first oil shock", followed by the 1979 oil crisis, termed the "second oil shock."
664	2925	The crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within NATO.
664	2926	Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott.
664	2927	Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents.
664	2928	To address this, the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants.
664	2929	They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights.
664	2930	By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula.
664	2931	The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974.
665	2932	On August 15, 1971, the United States unilaterally pulled out of the Bretton Woods Accord.
665	2933	The US abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar, whose value was left to "float" (rise and fall according to market demand).
665	2934	Shortly thereafter, Britain followed, floating the pound sterling.
665	2935	The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies.
665	2936	Anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time, the industrialized nations increased their reserves (by expanding their money supplies) in amounts far greater than before.
665	2937	The result was a depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations' currencies.
665	2938	Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased.
665	2939	In September 1971, OPEC issued a joint communiqué stating that, from then on, they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold.
666	2940	This contributed to the "Oil Shock".
666	2941	After 1971, OPEC was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation.
666	2942	From 1947 to 1967, the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year.
666	2943	Until the oil shock, the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities.
666	2944	OPEC ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions, so their real incomes lagged.
666	2945	The substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to Bretton Woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold.
667	2946	On October 6, 1973, Syria and Egypt, with support from other Arab nations, launched a surprise attack on Israel, on Yom Kippur.
667	2947	This renewal of hostilities in the Arab–Israeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices.
667	2948	At the time, Iran was the world's second-largest oil exporter and a close US ally.
667	2949	Weeks later, the Shah of Iran said in an interview: "Of course [the price of oil] is going to rise...
667	2950	You've [Western nations] increased the price of the wheat you sell us by 300 percent, and the same for sugar and cement... You buy our crude oil and sell it back to us, refined as petrochemicals, at a hundred times the price you've paid us...
667	2951	It's only fair that, from now on, you should pay more for oil.
668	2952	In response to American aid to Israel, on October 16, 1973, OPEC raised the posted price of oil by 70%, to $5.11 a barrel.
668	2953	The following day, oil ministers agreed to the embargo, a cut in production by five percent from September's output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met.
668	2954	On October 19, Nixon requested Congress to appropriate $2.2 billion in emergency aid to Israel, including $1.5 billion in outright grants.
668	2955	George Lenczowski notes, "Military supplies did not exhaust Nixon's eagerness to prevent Israel's collapse...This [$2.2 billion] decision triggered a collective OPEC response."
668	2956	Libya immediately announced it would embargo oil shipments to the United States.
668	2957	Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil-producing states joined the embargo on October 20, 1973.
668	2958	At their Kuwait meeting, OAPEC proclaimed the embargo that curbed exports to various countries and blocked all oil deliveries to the US as a "principal hostile country".
669	2959	Some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities, amid shrinking Western demand.
669	2960	Much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions, particularly in the Middle East.
669	2961	Saudi Arabia spent over 100 billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, known as Wahhabism, throughout the world, via religious charities such al-Haramain Foundation, which often also distributed funds to violent Sunni extremist groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
670	2962	In the United States, scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973.
670	2963	The possibility that the Middle East could become another superpower confrontation with the USSR was of more concern to the US than oil.
670	2964	Further, interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for Kissinger's dominance.
670	2965	In the US production, distribution and price disruptions "have been held responsible for recessions, periods of excessive inflation, reduced productivity, and lower economic growth."
671	2966	The embargo had a negative influence on the US economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to U.S. energy security.
671	2967	On an international level, the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries, such as automobiles.
671	2968	Macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts.
671	2969	The embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies, even in rugged terrain such as the Arctic.
671	2970	Finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to ten years before significant production.
672	2971	The embargo was not uniform across Europe.
672	2972	Of the nine members of the European Economic Community (EEC), the Netherlands faced a complete embargo, the UK and France received almost uninterrupted supplies (having refused to allow America to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the Arabs and the Israelis), while the other six faced partial cutbacks.
672	2973	The UK had traditionally been an ally of Israel, and Harold Wilson's government supported the Israelis during the Six-Day War.
672	2974	His successor, Ted Heath, reversed this policy in 1970, calling for Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders.
673	2975	Despite being relatively unaffected by the embargo, the UK nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its own - a series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of 1973–74 became a major factor in the change of government.
673	2976	Heath asked the British to heat only one room in their houses over the winter.
673	2977	The UK, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Norway banned flying, driving and boating on Sundays.
673	2978	Sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil.
673	2979	The Netherlands imposed prison sentences for those who used more than their ration of electricity.
674	2980	Price controls exacerbated the crisis in the US.
674	2981	The system limited the price of "old oil" (that which had already been discovered) while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment.
674	2982	Predictably, old oil was withdrawn from the market, creating greater scarcity.
674	2983	The rule also discouraged development of alternative energies.
674	2984	The rule had been intended to promote oil exploration.
674	2985	Scarcity was addressed by rationing (as in many countries).
674	2986	Motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973.
675	2987	In 1973, Nixon named William E. Simon as the first Administrator of the Federal Energy Office, a short-term organization created to coordinate the response to the embargo.
675	2988	Simon allocated states the same amount of domestic oil for 1974 that each had consumed in 1972, which worked for states whose populations were not increasing.
675	2989	In other states, lines at gasoline stations were common.
675	2990	The American Automobile Association reported that in the last week of February 1974, 20% of American gasoline stations had no fuel.
676	2991	To help reduce consumption, in 1974 a national maximum speed limit of 55 mph (about 88 km/h) was imposed through the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act.
676	2992	Development of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve began in 1975, and in 1977 the cabinet-level Department of Energy was created, followed by the National Energy Act of 1978.
676	2993	[citation needed] On November 28, 1995, Bill Clinton signed the National Highway Designation Act, ending the federal 55 mph (89 km/h) speed limit, allowing states to restore their prior maximum speed limit.
677	2994	The energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy, nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels.
677	2995	There is criticism that American energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking, promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities.
677	2996	Instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation, congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient, but whose prospects are doubtful.
678	2997	In 2004, declassified documents revealed that the U.S. was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize Middle Eastern oilfields in late 1973.
678	2998	Although no explicit plan was mentioned, a conversation between U.S. Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Cromer revealed Schlesinger had told him that "it was no longer obvious to him that the U.S. could not use force."
678	2999	British Prime Minister Edward Heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a British intelligence estimate of U.S. intentions, which concluded America "might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the U.S. and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries," and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and possibly Abu Dhabi in military action was decided upon.
678	3000	Although the Soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force, intelligence warned "the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the West developed alternative energy sources, and would result in the ‘total alienation’ of the Arabs and much of the rest of the Third World."
679	3001	Although lacking historical connections to the Middle East, Japan was the country most dependent on Arab oil.
679	3002	71% of its imported oil came from the Middle East in 1970.
679	3003	On November 7, 1973, the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments declared Japan a "nonfriendly" country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy.
679	3004	It received a 5% production cut in December, causing a panic.
679	3005	On November 22, Japan issued a statement "asserting that Israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories, advocating Palestinian self-determination, and threatening to reconsider its policy toward Israel if Israel refused to accept these preconditions".
679	3006	By December 25, Japan was considered an Arab-friendly state.
680	3007	The USSR's invasion of Afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region, also marked by increased American weapons sales, technology, and outright military presence.
680	3008	Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues.
680	3009	Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries.
680	3010	By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's.
680	3011	Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
680	3012	Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy.
680	3013	In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year.
680	3014	In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as "a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination."
681	3015	The crisis reduced the demand for large cars.
681	3016	Japanese imports, primarily the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Corolla, the Datsun B210, the Datsun 510, the Honda Civic, the Mitsubishi Galant (a captive import from Chrysler sold as the Dodge Colt), the Subaru DL, and later the Honda Accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical American V8 and six cylinder engines.
681	3017	Japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive, which became de facto standards.
682	3018	Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle.
682	3019	A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints, opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands.
683	3020	Compact trucks were introduced, such as the Toyota Hilux and the Datsun Truck, followed by the Mazda Truck (sold as the Ford Courier), and the Isuzu-built Chevrolet LUV.
683	3021	Mitsubishi rebranded its Forte as the Dodge D-50 a few years after the oil crisis.
683	3022	Mazda, Mitsubishi and Isuzu had joint partnerships with Ford, Chrysler, and GM, respectively.
683	3023	Later the American makers introduced their domestic replacements (Ford Ranger, Dodge Dakota and the Chevrolet S10/GMC S-15), ending their captive import policy.
684	3024	An increase in imported cars into North America forced General Motors, Ford and Chrysler to introduce smaller and fuel-efficient models for domestic sales.
684	3025	The Dodge Omni / Plymouth Horizon from Chrysler, the Ford Fiesta and the Chevrolet Chevette all had four-cylinder engines and room for at least four passengers by the late 1970s.
684	3026	By 1985, the average American vehicle moved 17.4 miles per gallon, compared to 13.5 in 1970.
684	3027	The improvements stayed even though the price of a barrel of oil remained constant at $12 from 1974 to 1979.
684	3028	Sales of large sedans for most makes (except Chrysler products) recovered within two model years of the 1973 crisis.
684	3029	The Cadillac DeVille and Fleetwood, Buick Electra, Oldsmobile 98, Lincoln Continental, Mercury Marquis, and various other luxury oriented sedans became popular again in the mid-1970s.
684	3030	The only full-size models that did not recover were lower price models such as the Chevrolet Bel Air, and Ford Galaxie 500.
684	3031	Slightly smaller, mid-size models such as the Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Ford Thunderbird and various other models sold well.
685	3032	Federal safety standards, such as NHTSA Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 215 (pertaining to safety bumpers), and compacts like the 1974 Mustang I were a prelude to the DOT "downsize" revision of vehicle categories.
685	3033	By 1977, GM's full-sized cars reflected the crisis.
685	3034	By 1979, virtually all "full-size" American cars had shrunk, featuring smaller engines and smaller outside dimensions.
685	3035	Chrysler ended production of their full-sized luxury sedans at the end of the 1981 model year, moving instead to a full front-wheel drive lineup for 1982 (except for the M-body Dodge Diplomat/Plymouth Gran Fury and Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue sedans).
686	3036	OPEC soon lost its preeminent position, and in 1981, its production was surpassed by that of other countries.
686	3037	Additionally, its own member nations were divided.
686	3038	Saudi Arabia, trying to recover market share, increased production, pushing prices down, shrinking or eliminating profits for high-cost producers.
686	3039	The world price, which had peaked during the 1979 energy crisis at nearly $40 per barrel, decreased during the 1980s to less than $10 per barrel.
686	3040	Adjusted for inflation, oil briefly fell back to pre-1973 levels.
686	3041	This "sale" price was a windfall for oil-importing nations, both developing and developed.
687	3042	The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the third United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which accomplished landing the first humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972.
687	3043	First conceived during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man Project Mercury which put the first Americans in space, Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy's national goal of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth" by the end of the 1960s, which he proposed in a May 25, 1961, address to Congress.
687	3044	Project Mercury was followed by the two-man Project Gemini (1962–66).
687	3045	The first manned flight of Apollo was in 1968.
688	3046	Apollo ran from 1961 to 1972, and was supported by the two-man Gemini program which ran concurrently with it from 1962 to 1966.
688	3047	Gemini missions developed some of the space travel techniques that were necessary for the success of the Apollo missions.
688	3048	Apollo used Saturn family rockets as launch vehicles.
688	3049	Apollo/Saturn vehicles were also used for an Apollo Applications Program, which consisted of Skylab, a space station that supported three manned missions in 1973–74, and the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, a joint Earth orbit mission with the Soviet Union in 1975.
689	3050	The Apollo program succeeded in achieving its goal of manned lunar landing, despite the major setback of a 1967 Apollo 1 cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test.
689	3051	After the first landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration.
689	3052	Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these.
689	3053	Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the Apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which disabled the command spacecraft's propulsion and life support.
689	3054	The crew returned to Earth safely by using the Lunar Module as a "lifeboat" for these functions.
690	3055	Apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones.
690	3056	It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit.
690	3057	Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while the final Apollo 17 mission marked the sixth Moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low Earth orbit.
690	3058	The program returned 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history.
690	3059	The program laid the foundation for NASA's current human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center.
690	3060	Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers.
691	3061	The Apollo program was conceived during the Eisenhower administration in early 1960, as a follow-up to Project Mercury.
691	3062	While the Mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three astronauts.
691	3063	Possible missions included ferrying crews to a space station, circumlunar flights, and eventual manned lunar landings.
691	3064	The program was named after the Greek god of light, music, and the sun by NASA manager Abe Silverstein, who later said that "I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby."
691	3065	Silverstein chose the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt "Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program."
692	3066	In July 1960, NASA Deputy Administrator Hugh L. Dryden announced the Apollo program to industry representatives at a series of Space Task Group conferences.
692	3067	Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a mission module cabin separate from the command module (piloting and re-entry cabin), and a propulsion and equipment module.
692	3068	On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced, and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded to General Dynamics/Convair, General Electric, and the Glenn L. Martin Company.
692	3069	Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by Maxime Faget, to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs.
693	3070	In November 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the Soviet Union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense.
693	3071	Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the "missile gap" that he and many other senators felt had formed between the Soviets and themselves due to the inaction of President Eisenhower.
693	3072	Beyond military power, Kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the US not "first but, first and, first if, but first period."
693	3073	Despite Kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the Apollo program once he became president.
693	3074	He knew little about the technical details of the space program, and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned Moon landing.
693	3075	When Kennedy's newly appointed NASA Administrator James E. Webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.
694	3076	On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union.
694	3077	At a meeting of the US House Committee on Science and Astronautics one day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up.
694	3078	Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.
695	3079	On April 20, Kennedy sent a memo to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, asking Johnson to look into the status of America's space program, and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up.
695	3080	Johnson responded approximately one week later, concluding that "we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership."
695	3081	His memo concluded that a manned Moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the United States would achieve it first.
696	3082	It became clear that managing the Apollo program would exceed the capabilities of Robert R. Gilruth's Space Task Group, which had been directing the nation's manned space program from NASA's Langley Research Center.
696	3083	So Gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new NASA center, the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC).
696	3084	A site was chosen in Houston, Texas, on land donated by Rice University, and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on September 19, 1961.
696	3085	It was also clear NASA would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch facilities in Florida, so a new Mission Control Center would be included in the MSC.
697	3086	It also became clear that Apollo would outgrow the Canaveral launch facilities in Florida.
697	3087	The two newest launch complexes were already being built for the Saturn I and IB rockets at the northernmost end: LC-34 and LC-37.
697	3088	But an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission, so land acquisition was started in July 1961 for a Launch Operations Center (LOC) immediately north of Canaveral at Merritt Island.
697	3089	The design, development and construction of the center was conducted by Kurt H. Debus, a member of Dr. Wernher von Braun's original V-2 rocket engineering team.
697	3090	Debus was named the LOC's first Director.
697	3091	Upon Kennedy's death, President Johnson issued an executive order on November 29, 1963, to rename the LOC and Cape Canaveral in honor of Kennedy.
698	3092	The LOC included Launch Complex 39, a Launch Control Center, and a 130 million cubic foot (3.7 million cubic meter) Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) in which the space vehicle (launch vehicle and spacecraft) would be assembled on a Mobile Launcher Platform and then moved by a transporter to one of several launch pads.
698	3093	Although at least three pads were planned, only two, designated A and B, were completed in October 1965.
698	3094	The LOC also included an Operations and Checkout Building (OCB) to which Gemini and Apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles.
698	3095	The Apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to 250,000 feet (76 km), which is nearly a vacuum.
699	3096	Administrator Webb realized that in order to keep Apollo costs under control, he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization, so he recruited Dr. George E. Mueller for a high management job.
699	3097	Mueller accepted, on the condition that he have a say in NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo.
699	3098	Webb then worked with Associate Administrator (later Deputy Administrator) Robert Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF).
699	3099	On July 23, 1963, Webb announced Mueller's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, to replace then Associate Administrator D. Brainerd Holmes on his retirement effective September 1.
699	3100	Under Webb's reorganization, the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center (Gilruth) Marshall Space Flight Center (von Braun) and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) effectively reported to Mueller.
700	3101	Based on his industry experience on Air Force missile projects, Mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high-ranking officers in the United States Air Force, so he got Webb's permission to recruit General Samuel C. Phillips, who gained a reputation for his effective management of the Minuteman program, as OMSF program controller.
700	3102	Phillips' superior officer Bernard A. Schriever agreed to loan Phillips to NASA, along with a staff of officers under him, on the condition that Phillips be made Apollo Program Director.
700	3103	Mueller agreed, and Phillips managed Apollo from January 1964, until it achieved the first manned landing in July 1969, after which he returned to Air Force duty.
701	3104	In early 1961, direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at NASA.
701	3105	Many engineers feared that a rendezvous —let alone a docking— neither of which had been attempted even in Earth orbit, would be extremely difficult in lunar orbit.
701	3106	Dissenters including John Houbolt at Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach.
701	3107	Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option.
701	3108	Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging that he spoke "somewhat as a voice in the wilderness," Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.
702	3109	 Seamans' establishment of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E. Golovin in July 1961, to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the Apollo program, represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision.
702	3110	This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode.
702	3111	Its consideration of LOR —as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work— played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach.
702	3112	In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR.
702	3113	The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing in June 1962.
703	3114	But even after NASA reached internal agreement, it was far from smooth sailing.
703	3115	Kennedy's science advisor Jerome Wiesner, who had expressed his opposition to manned spaceflight to Kennedy before the President took office, and had opposed the decision to land men on the Moon, hired Golovin, who had left NASA, to chair his own "Space Vehicle Panel", ostensibly to monitor, but actually to second-guess NASA's decisions on the Saturn V launch vehicle and LOR by forcing Shea, Seamans, and even Webb to defend themselves, delaying its formal announcement to the press on July 11, 1962, and forcing Webb to still hedge the decision as "tentative".
704	3116	Wiesner kept up the pressure, even making the disagreement public during a two-day September visit by the President to Marshall Space Flight Center.
704	3117	Wiesner blurted out "No, that's no good" in front of the press, during a presentation by von Braun.
704	3118	Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was "still subject to final review".
704	3119	Webb held firm, and issued a request for proposal to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors.
704	3120	Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October Cuban missile crisis, and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb.
704	3121	NASA announced the selection of Grumman as the LEM contractor in November 1962.
705	3122	The LOR method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a "lifeboat" in the event of a failure of the command ship.
705	3123	Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen.
705	3124	A 1964 MSC study concluded, "The LM [as lifeboat] ... was finally dropped, because no single reasonable CSM failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the SPS."
705	3125	Ironically, just such a failure happened on Apollo 13 when an oxygen tank explosion left the command ship without electrical power.
705	3126	The Lunar Module provided propulsion, electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely.
706	3127	Maxime Faget's preliminary Apollo design employed a cone-shaped command module, supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions.
706	3128	Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a Command/Service Module (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module.
706	3129	The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM, later shortened to Lunar Module, LM) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.
707	3130	The Command Module (CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing.
707	3131	It was the only component of the Apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early Apollo study designs.
707	3132	Its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield, and had its own reaction control system (RCS) engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path.
707	3133	Parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown.
707	3134	The module was 11.42 feet (3.48 m) tall, 12.83 feet (3.91 m) in diameter, and weighed approximately 12,250 pounds (5,560 kg).
708	3135	A cylindrical Service Module (SM) supported the Command Module, with a service propulsion engine and an RCS with propellants, and a fuel cell power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants.
708	3136	A high-gain S-band antenna was used for long-distance communications on the lunar flights.
708	3137	On the extended lunar missions, an orbital scientific instrument package was carried.
708	3138	The Service Module was discarded just before re-entry.
708	3139	The module was 24.6 feet (7.5 m) long and 12.83 feet (3.91 m) in diameter.
708	3140	The initial lunar flight version weighed approximately 51,300 pounds (23,300 kg) fully fueled, while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over 54,000 pounds (24,000 kg).
709	3141	North American Aviation won the contract to build the CSM, and also the second stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA.
709	3142	Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight.
709	3143	Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module.
709	3144	A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.
710	3145	The Lunar Module (LM) was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module.
710	3146	Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations, and was of an extremely lightweight construction.
710	3147	It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, each with its own engine.
710	3148	The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay consumables, and surface exploration equipment.
710	3149	The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant, and a reaction control system.
710	3150	The initial LM model weighed approximately 33,300 pounds (15,100 kg), and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours.
710	3151	An Extended Lunar Module weighed over 36,200 pounds (16,400 kg), and allowed surface stays of over 3 days.
711	3152	Before the Apollo program began, Wernher von Braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles, the Saturn series, and the even larger Nova series.
711	3153	In the midst of these plans, von Braun was transferred from the Army to NASA, and made Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center.
711	3154	The initial direct ascent plan to send the three-man Apollo Command/Service Module directly to the lunar surface, on top of a large descent rocket stage, would require a Nova-class launcher, with a lunar payload capability of over 180,000 pounds (82,000 kg).
711	3155	The June 11, 1962, decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the Saturn V to replace the Nova, and the MSFC proceeded to develop the Saturn rocket family for Apollo.
712	3156	The first four Saturn I test flights were launched from LC-34, with only live first stages, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water.
712	3157	The first flight with a live S-IV was launched from LC-37.
712	3158	This was followed by five launches of boilerplate CSMs (designated AS-101 through AS-105) into orbit in 1964 and 1965.
712	3159	The last three of these further supported the Apollo program by also carrying Pegasus satellites, which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts.
713	3160	The Saturn IB was an upgraded version of the Saturn I.
713	3161	The S-IB first stage increased the thrust to 1,600,000 pounds-force (7,120 kN), and the second stage replaced the S-IV with the S-IVB-200, powered by a single J-2 engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with LOX, to produce 200,000 lbf (890 kN) of thrust.
713	3162	A restartable version of the S-IVB was used as the third stage of the Saturn V. The Saturn IB could send over 40,000 pounds (18,100 kg) into low Earth orbit, sufficient for a partially fueled CSM or the LM.
713	3163	Saturn IB launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS-200 series number, "AS" indicating "Apollo Saturn" and the "2" indicating the second member of the Saturn rocket family.
714	3164	The three-stage Saturn V was designed to send a fully fueled CSM and LM to the Moon.
714	3165	It was 33 feet (10.1 m) in diameter and stood 363 feet (110.6 m) tall with its 96,800-pound (43,900 kg) lunar payload.
714	3166	Its capability grew to 103,600 pounds (47,000 kg) for the later advanced lunar landings.
714	3167	The S-IC first stage burned RP-1/LOX for a rated thrust of 7,500,000 pounds-force (33,400 kN), which was upgraded to 7,610,000 pounds-force (33,900 kN).
714	3168	The second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen, and the third stage was a modified version of the S-IVB, with thrust increased to 230,000 lbf (1,020 kN) and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching a parking orbit.
715	3169	The Apollo astronauts were chosen from the Project Mercury and Gemini veterans, plus from two later astronaut groups.
715	3170	All missions were commanded by Gemini or Mercury veterans.
715	3171	Crews on all development flights (except the Earth orbit CSM development flights) through the first two landings on Apollo 11 and Apollo 12, included at least two (sometimes three) Gemini veterans.
715	3172	Dr. Harrison Schmitt, a geologist, was the first NASA scientist astronaut to fly in space, and landed on the Moon on the last mission, Apollo 17.
715	3173	Schmitt participated in the lunar geology training of all of the Apollo landing crews.
716	3174	NASA awarded all 32 of these astronauts its highest honor, the Distinguished Service Medal, given for "distinguished service, ability, or courage", and personal "contribution representing substantial progress to the NASA mission".
716	3175	The medals were awarded posthumously to Grissom, White, and Chaffee in 1969, then to the crews of all missions from Apollo 8 onward.
716	3176	The crew that flew the first Earth orbital test mission Apollo 7, Walter M. Schirra, Donn Eisele, and Walter Cunningham, were awarded the lesser NASA Exceptional Service Medal, because of discipline problems with the Flight Director's orders during their flight.
716	3177	The NASA Administrator in October, 2008, decided to award them the Distinguished Service Medals, by this time posthumously to Schirra and Eisele.
717	3178	Two Block I CSMs were launched from LC-34 on suborbital flights in 1966 with the Saturn IB.
717	3179	The first, AS-201 launched on February 26, reached an altitude of 265.7 nautical miles (492.1 km) and splashed down 4,577 nautical miles (8,477 km) downrange in the Atlantic ocean.
717	3180	The second, AS-202 on August 25, reached 617.1 nautical miles (1,142.9 km) altitude and was recovered 13,900 nautical miles (25,700 km) downrange in the Pacific ocean.
717	3181	These flights validated the Service Module engine and the Command Module heat shield.
718	3182	After an unmanned LM test flight AS-206, a crew would fly the first Block II CSM and LM in a dual mission known as AS-207/208, or AS-278 (each spacecraft would be launched on a separate Saturn IB.)
718	3183	The Block II crew positions were titled Commander (CDR) Command Module Pilot (CMP) and Lunar Module Pilot (LMP).
718	3184	The astronauts would begin wearing a new Apollo spacesuit, designed to accommodate lunar extravehicular activity (EVA).
718	3185	The traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear "fishbowl" type for greater visibility, and the lunar surface EVA suit would include a water-cooled undergarment.
719	3186	Deke Slayton, the grounded Mercury astronaut who became Director of Flight Crew Operations for the Gemini and Apollo programs, selected the first Apollo crew in January 1966, with Grissom as Command Pilot, White as Senior Pilot, and rookie Donn F. Eisele as Pilot.
719	3187	But Eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the KC135 weightlessness training aircraft, and had to undergo surgery on January 27.
719	3188	NASA announced the final crew selection for AS-204 on March 21, 1966, with the backup crew consisting of Gemini veterans James McDivitt and David Scott, with rookie Russell L. "Rusty" Schweickart.
719	3189	Mercury/Gemini veteran Wally Schirra, Eisele, and rookie Walter Cunningham were announced on September 29 as the prime crew for AS-205.
720	3190	In December 1966, the AS-205 mission was canceled, since the validation of the CSM would be accomplished on the 14-day first flight, and AS-205 would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft.
720	3191	Its Saturn IB was allocated to the dual mission, now redesignated AS-205/208 or AS-258, planned for August 1967.
720	3192	McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart were promoted to the prime AS-258 crew, and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the Apollo 1 backup crew.
721	3193	The problems with North American were severe enough in late 1965 to cause Manned Space Flight Administrator George Mueller to appoint program director Samuel Phillips to head a "tiger team" to investigate North American's problems and identify corrections.
721	3194	Phillips documented his findings in a December 19 letter to NAA president Lee Atwood, with a strongly worded letter by Mueller, and also gave a presentation of the results to Mueller and Deputy Administrator Robert Seamans.
721	3195	Meanwhile, Grumman was also encountering problems with the Lunar Module, eliminating hopes it would be ready for manned flight in 1967, not long after the first manned CSM flights.
722	3196	Grissom, White, and Chaffee decided to name their flight Apollo 1 as a motivational focus on the first manned flight.
722	3197	They trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at North American, and in the altitude chamber at the Kennedy Space Center.
722	3198	A "plugs-out" test was planned for January, which would simulate a launch countdown on LC-34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad-supplied to internal power.
722	3199	If successful, this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the February 21 launch, with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled.
723	3200	The plugs-out test began on the morning of January 27, 1967, and immediately was plagued with problems.
723	3201	First the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits, which delayed the sealing of the hatch.
723	3202	Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown.
723	3203	During this hold, an electrical fire began in the cabin, and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere.
723	3204	Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin burst and the fire erupted onto the pad area, frustrating attempts to rescue the crew.
723	3205	The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened.
724	3206	NASA immediately convened an accident review board, overseen by both houses of Congress.
724	3207	While the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex, the review board concluded that "deficiencies existed in Command Module design, workmanship and quality control."
724	3208	At the insistence of NASA Administrator Webb, North American removed Harrison Storms as Command Module program manager.
724	3209	Webb also reassigned Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) Manager Joseph Francis Shea, replacing him with George Low.
725	3210	To remedy the causes of the fire, changes were made in the Block II spacecraft and operational procedures, the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch, and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials.
725	3211	The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block I plug-type hatch cover with a quick-release, outward opening door.
725	3212	NASA discontinued the manned Block I program, using the Block I spacecraft only for unmanned Saturn V flights.
725	3213	Crew members would also exclusively wear modified, fire-resistant Block II space suits, and would be designated by the Block II titles, regardless of whether a LM was present on the flight or not.
726	3214	In September 1967, Mueller approved a sequence of mission types which had to be successfully accomplished in order to achieve the manned lunar landing.
726	3215	Each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed, and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary; therefore letters were used instead of numbers.
726	3216	The A missions were unmanned Saturn V validation; B was unmanned LM validation using the Saturn IB; C was manned CSM Earth orbit validation using the Saturn IB; D was the first manned CSM/LM flight (this replaced AS-258, using a single Saturn V launch); E would be a higher Earth orbit CSM/LM flight; F would be the first lunar mission, testing the LM in lunar orbit but without landing (a "dress rehearsal"); and G would be the first manned landing.
726	3217	The list of types covered follow-on lunar exploration to include H lunar landings, I for lunar orbital survey missions, and J for extended-stay lunar landings.
727	3218	The delay in the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA to catch up on man-rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967.
727	3219	The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.
727	3220	This was followed on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast.
727	3221	The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry.
727	3222	The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages.
727	3223	Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate.
727	3224	The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection.
727	3225	Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4.
727	3226	Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test.
728	3227	Apollo 5 (AS-204) was the first unmanned test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1.
728	3228	The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing.
728	3229	The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a "fire-in-the-hole" test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage.
728	3230	Although Grumman wanted a second unmanned test, George Low decided the next LM flight would be manned.
729	3231	Apollo 8 was planned to be the D mission in December 1968, crewed by McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart, launched on a Saturn V instead of two Saturn IBs.
729	3232	In the summer it had become clear that the LM would not be ready in time.
729	3233	Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission.
729	3234	This would keep the program on track.
729	3235	The Soviet Union had sent animals around the Moon on September 15, 1968, aboard Zond 5, and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts.
729	3236	The decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of Apollo 7.
729	3237	Gemini veterans Frank Borman and James Lovell, and rookie William Anders captured the world's attention by making 10 lunar orbits in 20 hours, transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on Christmas Eve, and returning safely to Earth.
730	3238	The G mission was achieved on Apollo 11 in July 1969 by an all-Gemini veteran crew consisting of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin.
730	3239	Armstrong and Aldrin performed the first landing at the Sea of Tranquility at 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969.
730	3240	They spent a total of 21 hours, 36 minutes on the surface, and spent 2 hours, 31 minutes outside the spacecraft, walking on the surface, taking photographs, collecting material samples, and deploying automated scientific instruments, while continuously sending black-and-white television back to Earth.
730	3241	The astronauts returned safely on July 24.
731	3242	In November 1969, Gemini veteran Charles "Pete" Conrad and rookie Alan L. Bean made a precision landing on Apollo 12 within walking distance of the Surveyor 3 unmanned lunar probe, which had landed in April 1967 on the Ocean of Storms.
731	3243	The Command Module Pilot was Gemini veteran Richard F. Gordon, Jr. Conrad and Bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera, but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the Sun.
731	3244	They made two EVAs totaling 7 hours and 45 minutes.
731	3245	On one, they walked to the Surveyor, photographed it, and removed some parts which they returned to Earth.
732	3246	The contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs were enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20.
732	3247	NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days.
732	3248	These missions would also carry the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM.
732	3249	Also, the Block II spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.
733	3250	The success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as Commander, with two rookies.
733	3251	Apollo 13 launched Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise in April 1970, headed for the Fra Mauro formation.
733	3252	But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the Service Module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a "life boat" to return to Earth.
733	3253	Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications.
733	3254	Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added.
734	3255	About the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20.
734	3256	NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle.
734	3257	By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19.
734	3258	The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.
735	3259	The rocks collected from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured by radiometric dating techniques.
735	3260	They range in age from about 3.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust.
735	3261	As such, they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the Solar System, that are largely absent on Earth.
735	3262	One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the Genesis Rock, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission.
735	3263	This anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite, and is believed to be representative of the highland crust.
735	3264	A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered, which has no known terrestrial counterpart.
735	3265	KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see lunar magma ocean).
736	3266	Almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects.
736	3267	Many samples appear to be pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters, which is never seen on Earth rocks, due to the thick atmosphere.
736	3268	Many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events.
736	3269	Some of the returned samples are of impact melt (materials melted near an impact crater.)
736	3270	All samples returned from the Moon are highly brecciated as a result of being subjected to multiple impact events.
737	3271	In 2009, NASA held a symposium on project costs which presented an estimate of the Apollo program costs in 2005 dollars as roughly $170 billion.
737	3272	This included all research and development costs; the procurement of 15 Saturn V rockets, 16 Command/Service Modules, 12 Lunar Modules, plus program support and management costs; construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading, and costs for flight operations.
737	3273	This was based on a Congressional Budget Office report, A Budgetary Analysis of NASA's New Vision for Space, September 2004.
737	3274	The Space Review estimated in 2010 the cost of Apollo from 1959 to 1973 as $20.4 billion, or $109 billion in 2010 dollars.
738	3275	Looking beyond the manned lunar landings, NASA investigated several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware.
738	3276	The Apollo Extension Series (Apollo X,) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using the space in the Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop).
738	3277	Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station.
738	3278	This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage, and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP).
738	3279	The workshop was to be supplemented by Apollo Telescope Missions, which would replace the LM's descent stage equipment and engine with a solar telescope observatory.
738	3280	The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a Venus fly-by mission.
739	3281	The S-IVB orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board.
739	3282	Dubbed Skylab, it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space, and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a Saturn V. It was equipped with an Apollo Telescope Mount, the solar telescope that would have been used on the Apollo Telescope Missions.
739	3283	Skylab's last crew departed the station on February 8, 1974, and the station itself re-entered the atmosphere in 1979, by which time it had become the oldest operational Apollo-Saturn component.
740	3284	In 2008, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's SELENE probe observed evidence of the halo surrounding the Apollo 15 Lunar Module blast crater while orbiting above the lunar surface.
740	3285	In 2009, NASA's robotic Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, while orbiting 50 kilometers (31 mi) above the Moon, began photographing the remnants of the Apollo program left on the lunar surface, and photographed each site where manned Apollo flights landed.
740	3286	All of the U. S. flags left on the Moon during the Apollo missions were found to still be standing, with the exception of the one left during the Apollo 11 mission, which was blown over during that mission's lift-off from the lunar surface and return to the mission Command Module in lunar orbit; the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown.
741	3287	The crew of Apollo 8 sent the first live televised pictures of the Earth and the Moon back to Earth, and read from the creation story in the Book of Genesis, on Christmas Eve, 1968.
741	3288	An estimated one-quarter of the population of the world saw—either live or delayed—the Christmas Eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon.
741	3289	The mission and Christmas provided an inspiring end to 1968, which had been a troubled year for the US, marked by Vietnam War protests, race riots, and the assassinations of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., and Senator Robert F. Kennedy.
742	3290	The Moon landing data was recorded by a special Apollo TV camera which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast TV.
742	3291	This resulted in lunar footage that had to be converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic telemetry tapes.
742	3292	During the following years, a magnetic tape shortage prompted NASA to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the National Archives and Records Administration to be recorded over with newer satellite data.
742	3293	Stan Lebar, who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at Westinghouse Electric Corporation, also worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes.
743	3294	With a budget of $230,000, the surviving original lunar broadcast data from Apollo 11 was compiled by Nafzger and assigned to Lowry Digital for restoration.
743	3295	The video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy.
743	3296	The images were from tapes in Australia, the CBS News archive, and kinescope recordings made at Johnson Space Center.
743	3297	The restored video, remaining in black and white, contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements.
744	3298	European Union law is a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states.
744	3299	The three sources of European Union law are primary law, secondary law and supplementary law.
744	3300	The main sources of primary law are the Treaties establishing the European Union.
744	3301	Secondary sources include regulations and directives which are based on the Treaties.
744	3302	The legislature of the European Union is principally composed of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, which under the Treaties may establish secondary law to pursue the objective set out in the Treaties.
745	3303	European Union law is applied by the courts of member states and the Court of Justice of the European Union.
745	3304	Where the laws of member states provide for lesser rights European Union law can be enforced by the courts of member states.
745	3305	In case of European Union law which should have been transposed into the laws of member states, such as Directives, the European Commission can take proceedings against the member state under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
745	3306	The European Court of Justice is the highest court able to interpret European Union law.
745	3307	Supplementary sources of European Union law include case law by the Court of Justice, international law and general principles of European Union law.
746	3308	Although the European Union does not have a codified constitution, like every political body it has laws which "constitute" its basic governance structure.
746	3309	The EU's primary constitutional sources are the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which have been agreed or adhered to among the governments of all 28 member states.
746	3310	The Treaties establish the EU's institutions, list their powers and responsibilities, and explain the areas in which the EU can legislate with Directives or Regulations.
746	3311	The European Commission has the initiative to propose legislation.
746	3312	During the ordinary legislative procedure, the Council (which are ministers from member state governments) and the European Parliament (elected by citizens) can make amendments and must give their consent for laws to pass.
746	3313	The Commission oversees departments and various agencies that execute or enforce EU law.
746	3314	The "European Council" (rather than the Council, made up of different government Ministers) is composed of the Prime Ministers or executive Presidents of the member states.
746	3315	It appoints the Commissioners and the board of the European Central Bank.
746	3316	The European Court of Justice is the supreme judicial body which interprets EU law, and develops it through precedent.
746	3317	The Court can review the legality of the EU institutions' actions, in compliance with the Treaties.
746	3318	It can also decide upon claims for breach of EU laws from member states and citizens.
747	3319	The primary law of the EU consists mainly of the founding treaties, the "core" treaties being the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
747	3320	The Treaties contain formal and substantive provisions, which frame policies of the European Union institutions and determine the division of competences between the European Union and its member states.
747	3321	The TEU establishes that European Union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states, as well as certain islands and overseas territories, including Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments.
747	3322	European Union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations, for example Gibraltar and the Åland islands.
747	3323	The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions, as for example done for customs matters in Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon.
747	3324	The TEU specifically excludes certain regions, for example the Faroe Islands, from the jurisdiction of European Union law.
747	3325	Treaties apply as soon as they enter into force, unless stated otherwise, and are generally concluded for an unlimited period.
747	3326	The TEU provides that commitments entered into by the member states between themselves before the treaty was signed no longer apply.
747	3327	[vague] All EU member states are regarded as subject to the general obligation of the principle of cooperation, as stated in the TEU, whereby member states are obliged not to take measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the TEU objectives.
747	3328	The Court of Justice of the European Union can interpret the Treaties, but it cannot rule on their validity, which is subject to international law.
747	3329	Individuals may rely on primary law in the Court of Justice of the European Union if the Treaty provisions have a direct effect and they are sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional.
748	3330	The principal Treaties that form the European Union began with common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy, but more complete and formal institutions were established through the Treaty of Rome 1957 and the Maastricht Treaty 1992 (now: TFEU).
748	3331	Minor amendments were made during the 1960s and 1970s.
748	3332	Major amending treaties were signed to complete the development of a single, internal market in the Single European Act 1986, to further the development of a more social Europe in the Treaty of Amsterdam 1997, and to make minor amendments to the relative power of member states in the EU institutions in the Treaty of Nice 2001 and the Treaty of Lisbon 2007.
748	3333	Since its establishment, more member states have joined through a series of accession treaties, from the UK, Ireland, Denmark and Norway in 1972 (though Norway did not end up joining), Greece in 1979, Spain and Portugal 1985, Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden in 1994 (though again Norway failed to join, because of lack of support in the referendum), the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004, Romania and Bulgaria in 2007 and Croatia in 2013.
748	3334	Greenland signed a Treaty in 1985 giving it a special status.
749	3335	Following the Nice Treaty, there was an attempt to reform the constitutional law of the European Union and make it more transparent; this would have also produced a single constitutional document.
749	3336	However, as a result of the referendum in France and the referendum in the Netherlands, the 2004 Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe never came into force.
749	3337	Instead, the Lisbon Treaty was enacted.
749	3338	Its substance was very similar to the proposed constitutional treaty, but it was formally an amending treaty, and – though it significantly altered the existing treaties – it did not completely replace them.
750	3339	The European Commission is the main executive body of the European Union.
750	3340	Article 17(1) of the Treaty on European Union states the Commission should "promote the general interest of the Union" while Article 17(3) adds that Commissioners should be "completely independent" and not "take instructions from any Government".
750	3341	Under article 17(2), "Union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal, except where the Treaties provide otherwise."
750	3342	This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, although the Council is the "de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives".
750	3343	The Parliament can also formally request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal but the Commission can reject such a suggestion, giving reasons.
750	3344	The Commission's President (currently an ex-Luxembourg Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker) sets the agenda for the EU's work.
750	3345	Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote, usually through a "written procedure" of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections.
750	3346	[citation needed] Since Ireland refused to consent to changes in the Treaty of Lisbon 2007, there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states, including the President and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy (currently Federica Mogherini).
750	3347	The Commissioners (and most importantly, the portfolios they will hold) are bargained over intensively by the member states.
750	3348	The Commissioners, as a block, are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament.
750	3349	The proposal to make the Commissioners be drawn from the elected Parliament, was not adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon.
750	3350	This means Commissioners are, through the appointment process, the unelected subordinates of member state governments.
751	3351	Commissioners have various privileges, such as being exempt from member state taxes (but not EU taxes), and having immunity from prosecution for doing official acts.
751	3352	Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices, particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations.
751	3353	This resulted in one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law.
751	3354	By contrast to the ECJ's relaxed approach, a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had ‘even the slightest sense of responsibility’.
751	3355	This led to the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office.
751	3356	In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health, John Dalli, who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a €60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive.
751	3357	Beyond the Commission, the European Central Bank has relative executive autonomy in its conduct of monetary policy for the purpose of managing the euro.
751	3358	It has a six-person board appointed by the European Council, on the Council's recommendation.
751	3359	The President of the Council and a Commissioner can sit in on ECB meetings, but do not have voting rights.
752	3360	The second main legislative body is the Council, which is composed of different ministers of the member states.
752	3361	The heads of government of member states also convene a "European Council" (a distinct body) that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the 'necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities'.
752	3362	It meets each six months and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk) is meant to 'drive forward its work', but it does not itself 'legislative functions'.
752	3363	The Council does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g.
752	3364	for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers attend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.).
752	3365	The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions.
752	3366	When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size, so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states.
752	3367	In total there are 352 votes, but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote, if not consensus.
752	3368	TEU article 16(4) and TFEU article 238(3) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU: currently this means around 74 per cent, or 260 of the 352 votes.
752	3369	This is critical during the legislative process.
753	3370	To make new legislation, TFEU article 294 defines the "ordinary legislative procedure" that applies for most EU acts.
753	3371	The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment.
753	3372	Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a "Conciliation Committee" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority.
753	3373	This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same.
753	3374	A different procedure exists for budgets.
753	3375	For "enhanced cooperation" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council.
753	3376	Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure.
753	3377	The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties.
753	3378	TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the "competence" to define the EU's "competence".
753	3379	Many member state courts believe they decide, other member state Parliaments believe they decide, while within the EU, the Court of Justice believes it has the final say.
754	3380	The judicial branch of the EU has played an important role in the development of EU law, by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties, and accelerating economic and political integration.
754	3381	Today the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the main judicial body, within which there is a higher European Court of Justice (commonly abbreviated as ECJ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance, and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance.
754	3382	There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues, and then a separate Court of Auditors.
754	3383	Under the Treaty on European Union article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state, 28 at present, who are supposed to "possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices" (or for the General Court, the "ability required for appointment to high judicial office").
754	3384	A president is elected by the judges for three years.
754	3385	Under TEU article 19(3) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law.
754	3386	In fact, most EU law is applied by member state courts (the English Court of Appeal, the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Belgian Cour du travail, etc.)
754	3387	but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling.
754	3388	The CJEU's duty is to "ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate.
754	3389	Arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments, including Van Gend en Loos, Mangold v Helm, and Kadi v Commission.
755	3390	Generally speaking, while all member states recognise that EU law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the Treaties, they do not accept that the Court of Justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights.
755	3391	In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law.
755	3392	This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU.
755	3393	It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that "whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary" and so "it has always been clear" that UK courts have a duty "to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law."
755	3394	More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, there could be "fundamental principles" of common law, and Parliament "did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation" of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972.
755	3395	The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law.
755	3396	However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, "so long as" the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles.
755	3397	Most other member states have expressed similar reservations.
755	3398	This suggests the EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.
756	3399	While constitutional law concerns the European Union's governance structure, administrative law binds EU institutions and member states to follow the law.
756	3400	Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or "standing" (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties.
756	3401	From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations.
756	3402	However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties.
756	3403	This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation.
756	3404	These rules on "direct effect" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law.
756	3405	All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged.
756	3406	The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible.
757	3407	Although it is generally accepted that EU law has primacy, not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims: that is, not all EU laws have "direct effect".
757	3408	In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that the provisions of the Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them.
757	3409	Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands.
757	3410	After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not "expressly" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so.
757	3411	Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed "the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law".
757	3412	Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff.
757	3413	EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are ‘directly applicable in all Member States’.
757	3414	Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion.
757	3415	For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions.
757	3416	"Regulations," held the Court of Justice, "come into force solely by virtue of their publication" and implementation could have the effect of "jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union."
757	3417	On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed.
758	3418	While the Treaties and Regulations will have direct effect (if clear, unconditional and immediate), Directives do not generally give citizens (as opposed to the member state) standing to sue other citizens.
758	3419	In theory, this is because TFEU article 288 says Directives are addressed to the member states and usually "leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods" to implement.
758	3420	In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards.
758	3421	For example, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law.
758	3422	However, on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice, citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives, but not from Directives themselves.
758	3423	Directives do not have so called "horizontal" direct effect (i.e.
758	3424	This view was instantly controversial, and in the early 1990s three Advocate Generals persuasively argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens.
758	3425	The Court of Justice refused, but there are five large exceptions.
759	3426	Fourth, national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law "as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive".
759	3427	Textbooks (though not the Court itself) often called this "indirect effect".
759	3428	In Marleasing SA v La Comercial SA the Court of Justice held that a Spanish Court had to interpret its general Civil Code provisions, on contracts lacking cause or defrauding creditors, to conform with the First Company Law Directive article 11, that required incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons.
759	3429	The Court of Justice quickly acknowledged that the duty of interpretation cannot contradict plain words in a national statute.
759	3430	But, fifth, if a member state has failed to implement a Directive, a citizen may not be able to bring claims against other non-state parties, but can sue the member state itself for failure to implement the law.
759	3431	So, in Francovich v Italy, the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required.
759	3432	Francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss.
759	3433	The Court of Justice held that if a Directive would confer identifiable rights on individuals, and there is a causal link between a member state's violation of EU and a claimant's loss, damages must be paid.
759	3434	The fact that the incompatible law is an Act of Parliament is no defence.
760	3435	The principles of European Union law are rules of law which have been developed by the European Court of Justice that constitute unwritten rules which are not expressly provided for in the treaties but which affect how European Union law is interpreted and applies.
760	3436	In formulating these principles, the courts have drawn on a variety of sources, including: public international law and legal doctrines and principles present in the legal systems of European Union member states and in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.
760	3437	Accepted general principles of European Union Law include fundamental rights (see human rights), proportionality, legal certainty, equality before the law and subsidiarity.
761	3438	Proportionality is recognised one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1950s.
761	3439	According to the general principle of proportionality the lawfulness of an action depends on whether it was appropriate and necessary to achieve the objectives legitimately pursued.
761	3440	When there is a choice between several appropriate measures the least onerous must be adopted, and any disadvantage caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued.
761	3441	The principle of proportionality is also recognised in Article 5 of the EC Treaty, stating that "any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Treaty".
762	3442	The concept of legal certainty is recognised one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1960s.
762	3443	It is an important general principle of international law and public law, which predates European Union law.
762	3444	As a general principle in European Union law it means that the law must be certain, in that it is clear and precise, and its legal implications foreseeable, specially when applied to financial obligations.
762	3445	The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis.
762	3446	Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law.
762	3447	In European Union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits Ex post facto laws, i.e.
762	3448	laws should not take effect before they are published.
762	3449	The doctrine of legitimate expectation, which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith, is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law.
762	3450	The legitimate expectation doctrine holds that and that "those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is or seems to be should not be frustrated in their expectations".
763	3451	Fundamental rights, as in human rights, were first recognised by the European Court of Justice in the late 60s and fundamental rights are now regarded as integral part of the general principles of European Union law.
763	3452	As such the European Court of Justice is bound to draw inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the member states.
763	3453	Therefore, the European Court of Justice cannot uphold measures which are incompatible with fundamental rights recognised and protected in the constitutions of member states.
763	3454	The European Court of Justice also found that "international treaties for the protection of human rights on which the member states have collaborated or of which they are signatories, can supply guidelines which should be followed within the framework of Community law."
764	3455	None of the original treaties establishing the European Union mention protection for fundamental rights.
764	3456	It was not envisaged for European Union measures, that is legislative and administrative actions by European Union institutions, to be subject to human rights.
764	3457	At the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights, hence the establishment of the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950 and the establishment of the European Court of Human Rights.
764	3458	The European Court of Justice recognised fundamental rights as general principle of European Union law as the need to ensure that European Union measures are compatible with the human rights enshrined in member states' constitution became ever more apparent.
764	3459	In 1999 the European Council set up a body tasked with drafting a European Charter of Human Rights, which could form the constitutional basis for the European Union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the European Union and its institutions.
764	3460	The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union draws a list of fundamental rights from the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Declaration on Fundamental Rights produced by the European Parliament in 1989 and European Union Treaties.
765	3461	The 2007 Lisbon Treaty explicitly recognised fundamental rights by providing in Article 6(1) that "The Union recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of 7 December 2000, as adopted at Strasbourg on 12 December 2007, which shall have the same legal value as the Treaties."
765	3462	Therefore, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has become an integral part of European Union law, codifying the fundamental rights which were previously considered general principles of European Union law.
765	3463	In effect, after the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter and the Convention now co-exist under European Union law, though the former is enforced by the European Court of Justice in relation to European Union measures, and the latter by the European Court of Human Rights in relation to measures by member states.
766	3464	The Social Chapter is a chapter of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam covering social policy issues in European Union law.
766	3465	The basis for the Social Chapter was developed in 1989 by the "social partners" representatives, namely UNICE, the employers' confederation, the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and CEEP, the European Centre of Public Enterprises.
766	3466	A toned down version was adopted as the Social Charter at the 1989 Strasbourg European Council.
766	3467	The Social Charter declares 30 general principles, including on fair remuneration of employment, health and safety at work, rights of disabled and elderly, the rights of workers, on vocational training and improvements of living conditions.
766	3468	The Social Charter became the basis for European Community legislation on these issues in 40 pieces of legislation.
767	3469	The Social Charter was subsequently adopted in 1989 by 11 of the then 12 member states.
767	3470	The UK refused to sign the Social Charter and was exempt from the legislation covering Social Charter issues unless it agreed to be bound by the legislation.
767	3471	The UK subsequently was the only member state to veto the Social Charter being included as the "Social Chapter" of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty - instead, an Agreement on Social Policy was added as a protocol.
767	3472	Again, the UK was exempt from legislation arising from the protocol, unless it agreed to be bound by it.
767	3473	The protocol was to become known as "Social Chapter", despite not actually being a chapter of the Maastricht Treaty.
767	3474	To achieve aims of the Agreement on Social Policy the European Union was to "support and complement" the policies of member states.
767	3475	The aims of the Agreement on Social Policy are:
768	3476	Following the election of the UK Labour Party to government in 1997, the UK formally subscribed to the Agreement on Social Policy, which allowed it to be included with minor amendments as the Social Chapter of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam.
768	3477	The UK subsequently adopted the main legislation previously agreed under the Agreement on Social Policy, the 1994 Works Council Directive, which required workforce consultation in businesses, and the 1996 Parental Leave Directive.
768	3478	In the 10 years following the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam and adoption of the Social Chapter the European Union has undertaken policy initiatives in various social policy areas, including labour and industry relations, equal opportunity, health and safety, public health, protection of children, the disabled and elderly, poverty, migrant workers, education, training and youth.
769	3479	EU Competition law has its origins in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) agreement between France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany in 1951 following the second World War.
769	3480	The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war.
769	3481	Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies.
769	3482	This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law.
769	3483	In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC).
769	3484	The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the "institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted".
769	3485	The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position.
769	3486	The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid.
769	3487	Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time.
770	3488	Today, the Treaty of Lisbon prohibits anti-competitive agreements in Article 101(1), including price fixing.
770	3489	According to Article 101(2) any such agreements are automatically void.
770	3490	Article 101(3) establishes exemptions, if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation, gives consumers a "fair share" of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints that risk eliminating competition anywhere (or compliant with the general principle of European Union law of proportionality).
770	3491	Article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position, such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing.
770	3492	Article 102 allows the European Council to regulations to govern mergers between firms (the current regulation is the Regulation 139/2004/EC).
770	3493	The general test is whether a concentration (i.e.
770	3494	merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e.
770	3495	affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede effective competition.
770	3496	Articles 106 and 107 provide that member state's right to deliver public services may not be obstructed, but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies.
770	3497	Article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for charities, regional development objectives and in the event of a natural disaster.
771	3498	While the concept of a "social market economy" was only introduced into EU law in 2007, free movement and trade were central to European development since the Treaty of Rome 1957.
771	3499	According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects.
771	3500	Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices.
771	3501	It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state.
771	3502	In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the "endgame" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood.
771	3503	In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities.
771	3504	The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital.
771	3505	These so-called "four freedoms" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e.g.
771	3506	differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e.g.
771	3507	The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit.
771	3508	The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement.
771	3509	Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people's well being.
772	3510	In contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that "selling arrangements" would be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact.
772	3511	In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful.
772	3512	The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade.
772	3513	The Court of Justice held, as "in law and in fact" it was an equally applicable "selling arrangement" (not something that alters a product's content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified.
772	3514	Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect "in fact" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing.
772	3515	In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products.
772	3516	While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were "the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate" the market.
772	3517	In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' "traditional social practices and to local habits and customs" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health.
772	3518	Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair.
772	3519	Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice.
772	3520	The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory "race to the bottom", while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent.
773	3521	Since its foundation, the Treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement.
773	3522	Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a "factor of production".
773	3523	However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more "social" Europe.
773	3524	Free movement was increasingly based on "citizenship", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights.
773	3525	This means the basic "worker" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21.
773	3526	According to the Court of Justice, a "worker" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, "under the direction of another person" for "remuneration".
773	3527	A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker.
773	3528	For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions.
773	3529	The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an "indirect quid pro quo" for the work he did.
773	3530	Having "worker" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights.
773	3531	By contrast a citizen, who is "any person having the nationality of a Member State" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security.
773	3532	In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time).
773	3533	Nevertheless, practically "all available research finds little impact" of "labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers".
774	3534	Citizenship of the EU has increasingly been seen as a "fundamental" status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice, and has accordingly increased the number of social services that people can access wherever they move.
774	3535	The Court has required that higher education, along with other forms of vocational training, should be more access, albeit with qualifying periods.
774	3536	In Commission v Austria the Court held that Austria was not entitled to restrict places in Austrian universities to Austrian students to avoid "structural, staffing and financial problems" if (mainly German) foreign students applied for places because there was little evidence of an actual problem.
775	3537	As well as creating rights for "workers" who generally lack bargaining power in the market, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also protects the "freedom of establishment" in article 49, and "freedom to provide services" in article 56.
775	3538	In Gebhard v Consiglio dell’Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be "established" means to participate in economic life "on a stable and continuous basis", while providing "services" meant pursuing activity more "on a temporary basis".
775	3539	This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom, rather than service freedom.
775	3540	However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory, "justified by imperative requirements in the general interest" and proportionately applied.
775	3541	All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self-employed, or "undertakings" such as companies or firms, have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions.
775	3542	The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both "vertical" and "horizontal" direct effect.
775	3543	In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified.
775	3544	TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise "official authority", but this did an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official.
775	3545	By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction.
775	3546	The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market.
775	3547	Therefore, there was no prima facie infringement freedom of establishment that needed to be justified.
776	3548	In 2006, a toxic waste spill off the coast of Côte d'Ivoire, from a European ship, prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste.
776	3549	Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas stated that "Such highly toxic waste should never have left the European Union".
776	3550	With countries such as Spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic waste, Franco Frattini, the Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner, proposed with Dimas to create criminal sentences for "ecological crimes".
776	3551	The competence for the Union to do this was contested in 2005 at the Court of Justice resulting in a victory for the Commission.
776	3552	That ruling set a precedent that the Commission, on a supranational basis, may legislate in criminal law – something never done before.
776	3553	So far, the only other proposal has been the draft intellectual property rights directive.
776	3554	Motions were tabled in the European Parliament against that legislation on the basis that criminal law should not be an EU competence, but was rejected at vote.
776	3555	However, in October 2007, the Court of Justice ruled that the Commission could not propose what the criminal sanctions could be, only that there must be some.
777	3556	The Amazon rainforest (Portuguese: Floresta Amazônica or Amazônia; Spanish: Selva Amazónica, Amazonía or usually Amazonia; French: Forêt amazonienne; Dutch: Amazoneregenwoud), also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America.
777	3557	This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest.
777	3558	This region includes territory belonging to nine nations.
777	3559	The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.
777	3560	States or departments in four nations contain "Amazonas" in their names.
777	3561	The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.
778	3562	Following the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent.
778	3563	From 66–34 Mya, the rainforest extended as far south as 45°.
778	3564	Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics.
778	3565	During the Oligocene, for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band.
778	3566	It expanded again during the Middle Miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum.
778	3567	However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.
779	3568	During the mid-Eocene, it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch.
779	3569	Water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic, while to the west water flowed toward the Pacific across the Amazonas Basin.
779	3570	As the Andes Mountains rose, however, a large basin was created that enclosed a lake; now known as the Solimões Basin.
779	3571	Within the last 5–10 million years, this accumulating water broke through the Purus Arch, joining the easterly flow toward the Atlantic.
780	3572	There is evidence that there have been significant changes in Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation.
780	3573	Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin.
780	3574	There is debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was.
780	3575	Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today.
780	3576	This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.
782	3577	For a long time, it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated, as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil.
782	3578	Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise.
782	3579	She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population.
782	3580	However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated.
782	3581	Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Marajó, and inland dwellers.
782	3582	By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.
783	3583	The first European to travel the length of the Amazon River was Francisco de Orellana in 1542.
783	3584	The BBC's Unnatural Histories presents evidence that Orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought, was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s.
783	3585	It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe, such as smallpox.
783	3586	Since the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between AD 0–1250, furthering claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations.
783	3587	Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre.
783	3588	The BBC's Unnatural Histories presented evidence that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta.
784	3589	Terra preta (black earth), which is distributed over large areas in the Amazon forest, is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management.
784	3590	The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment; meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed.
784	3591	In the region of the Xingu tribe, remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida.
784	3592	Among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas.
785	3593	The region is home to about 2.5 million insect species, tens of thousands of plants, and some 2,000 birds and mammals.
785	3594	To date, at least 40,000 plant species, 2,200 fishes, 1,294 birds, 427 mammals, 428 amphibians, and 378 reptiles have been scientifically classified in the region.
785	3595	One in five of all the bird species in the world live in the rainforests of the Amazon, and one in five of the fish species live in Amazonian rivers and streams.
785	3596	Scientists have described between 96,660 and 128,843 invertebrate species in Brazil alone.
786	3597	The biodiversity of plant species is the highest on Earth with one 2001 study finding a quarter square kilometer (62 acres) of Ecuadorian rainforest supports more than 1,100 tree species.
786	3598	A study in 1999 found one square kilometer (247 acres) of Amazon rainforest can contain about 90,790 tonnes of living plants.
786	3599	The average plant biomass is estimated at 356 ± 47 tonnes per hectare.
786	3600	To date, an estimated 438,000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or catalogued.
786	3601	The total number of tree species in the region is estimated at 16,000.
787	3602	The rainforest contains several species that can pose a hazard.
787	3603	Among the largest predatory creatures are the black caiman, jaguar, cougar, and anaconda.
787	3604	In the river, electric eels can produce an electric shock that can stun or kill, while piranha are known to bite and injure humans.
787	3605	Various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh.
787	3606	There are also numerous parasites and disease vectors.
787	3607	Vampire bats dwell in the rainforest and can spread the rabies virus.
787	3608	Malaria, yellow fever and Dengue fever can also be contracted in the Amazon region.
788	3609	Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas.
788	3610	The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land.
788	3611	Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact.
788	3612	Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method.
788	3613	However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion.
788	3614	The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land.
788	3615	These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage.
788	3616	Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space.
789	3617	Between 1991 and 2000, the total area of forest lost in the Amazon rose from 415,000 to 587,000 square kilometres (160,000 to 227,000 sq mi), with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle.
789	3618	Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock pasture.
789	3619	Currently, Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States.
789	3620	New research however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes.
789	3621	So despite the popular perception, there has been no economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields.
790	3622	The needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the Amazon.
790	3623	The first two highways successfully opened up the rainforest and led to increased settlement and deforestation.
790	3624	The mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 (22,392 km2 or 8,646 sq mi per year) was 18% higher than in the previous five years (19,018 km2 or 7,343 sq mi per year).
790	3625	Although deforestation has declined significantly in the Brazilian Amazon between 2004 and 2014, there has been an increase to the present day.
791	3626	Environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest, and also about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation, which could accelerate global warming.
791	3627	Amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10% of the world's terrestrial primary productivity and 10% of the carbon stores in ecosystems—of the order of 1.1 × 1011 metric tonnes of carbon.
791	3628	Amazonian forests are estimated to have accumulated 0.62 ± 0.37 tons of carbon per hectare per year between 1975 and 1996.
792	3629	One computer model of future climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions shows that the Amazon rainforest could become unsustainable under conditions of severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures, leading to an almost complete loss of rainforest cover in the basin by 2100.
792	3630	However, simulations of Amazon basin climate change across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response, ranging from weak increases to strong decreases.
792	3631	The result indicates that the rainforest could be threatened though the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation.
793	3632	As indigenous territories continue to be destroyed by deforestation and ecocide, such as in the Peruvian Amazon indigenous peoples' rainforest communities continue to disappear, while others, like the Urarina continue to struggle to fight for their cultural survival and the fate of their forested territories.
793	3633	Meanwhile, the relationship between non-human primates in the subsistence and symbolism of indigenous lowland South American peoples has gained increased attention, as have ethno-biology and community-based conservation efforts.
794	3634	The use of remote sensing for the conservation of the Amazon is also being used by the indigenous tribes of the basin to protect their tribal lands from commercial interests.
794	3635	Using handheld GPS devices and programs like Google Earth, members of the Trio Tribe, who live in the rainforests of southern Suriname, map out their ancestral lands to help strengthen their territorial claims.
794	3636	Currently, most tribes in the Amazon do not have clearly defined boundaries, making it easier for commercial ventures to target their territories.
795	3637	To accurately map the Amazon's biomass and subsequent carbon related emissions, the classification of tree growth stages within different parts of the forest is crucial.
795	3638	In 2006 Tatiana Kuplich organized the trees of the Amazon into four categories: (1) mature forest, (2) regenerating forest [less than three years], (3) regenerating forest [between three and five years of regrowth], and (4) regenerating forest [eleven to eighteen years of continued development].
795	3639	The researcher used a combination of Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Thematic Mapper (TM) to accurately place the different portions of the Amazon into one of the four classifications.
796	3640	In 2005, parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in one hundred years, and there were indications that 2006 could have been a second successive year of drought.
796	3641	A July 23, 2006 article in the UK newspaper The Independent reported Woods Hole Research Center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought.
796	3642	Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a "tipping point" where it would irreversibly start to die.
796	3643	It concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate.
797	3644	In 2010 the Amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought, in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought.
797	3645	The affected region was approximate 1,160,000 square miles (3,000,000 km2) of rainforest, compared to 734,000 square miles (1,900,000 km2) in 2005.
797	3646	The 2010 drought had three epicenters where vegetation died off, whereas in 2005 the drought was focused on the southwestern part.
797	3647	The findings were published in the journal Science.
797	3648	In a typical year the Amazon absorbs 1.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide; during 2005 instead 5 gigatons were released and in 2010 8 gigatons were released.
798	3649	Ctenophora (/tᵻˈnɒfərə/; singular ctenophore, /ˈtɛnəfɔːr/ or /ˈtiːnəfɔːr/; from the Greek κτείς kteis 'comb' and φέρω pherō 'carry'; commonly known as comb jellies) is a phylum of animals that live in marine waters worldwide.
798	3650	Their most distinctive feature is the ‘combs’ – groups of cilia which they use for swimming – they are the largest animals that swim by means of cilia.
798	3651	Adults of various species range from a few millimeters to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in size.
798	3652	Like cnidarians, their bodies consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells on the outside and another lining the internal cavity.
798	3653	In ctenophores, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep.
798	3654	Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum, Coelenterata, as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration.
798	3655	Increasing awareness of the differences persuaded more recent authors to classify them as separate phyla.
799	3656	Almost all ctenophores are predators, taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species, which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed.
799	3657	In favorable circumstances, ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day.
799	3658	Only 100–150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named.
799	3659	The textbook examples are cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles") that are covered with colloblasts, sticky cells that capture prey.
799	3660	The phylum has a wide range of body forms, including the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the adults of most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large, stiffened cilia that act as teeth.
799	3661	These variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area, because they specialize in different types of prey, which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use.
800	3662	Most species are hermaphrodites—a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg, not needing a mate.
800	3663	Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time.
800	3664	Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times.
800	3665	Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch.
800	3666	The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow.
800	3667	The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form.
800	3668	In at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape.
800	3669	The combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate.
801	3670	Ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations, but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find.
801	3671	In bays where they occur in very high numbers, predation by ctenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton (planktonic plants), which are a vital part of marine food chains.
801	3672	One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish.
801	3673	The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the Mnemiopsis population.
801	3674	The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.
802	3675	Despite their soft, gelatinous bodies, fossils thought to represent ctenophores, apparently with no tentacles but many more comb-rows than modern forms, have been found in lagerstätten as far back as the early Cambrian, about 515 million years ago.
802	3676	The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores.
802	3677	A recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid-like, and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently, probably after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago.
802	3678	Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the "cydippids" are not monophyletic, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids.
803	3679	Ctenophores form an animal phylum that is more complex than sponges, about as complex as cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.
803	3680	), and less complex than bilaterians (which include almost all other animals).
803	3681	Unlike sponges, both ctenophores and cnidarians have: cells bound by inter-cell connections and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs.
803	3682	Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few ctenophore species lack them.
804	3683	Like sponges and cnidarians, ctenophores have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly-like material, which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer.
804	3684	Hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic, along with sponges.
804	3685	Both ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle that, in more complex animals, arises from the middle cell layer, and as a result some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic, while others still regard them as diploblastic.
805	3686	Ranging from about 1 millimeter (0.039 in) to 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) in size, ctenophores are the largest non-colonial animals that use cilia ("hairs") as their main method of locomotion.
805	3687	Most species have eight strips, called comb rows, that run the length of their bodies and bear comb-like bands of cilia, called "ctenes," stacked along the comb rows so that when the cilia beat, those of each comb touch the comb below.
805	3688	The name "ctenophora" means "comb-bearing", from the Greek κτείς (stem-form κτεν-) meaning "comb" and the Greek suffix -φορος meaning "carrying".
806	3689	For a phylum with relatively few species, ctenophores have a wide range of body plans.
806	3690	Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study.
806	3691	In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes.
806	3692	Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis.
806	3693	At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.
807	3694	The internal cavity forms: a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles; a pharynx ("throat"); a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach; and a system of internal canals.
807	3695	These branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal: the mouth and pharynx; the roots of the tentacles, if present; all along the underside of each comb row; and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth – two of these four branches terminate in anal pores.
807	3696	The inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium, the gastrodermis.
807	3697	The mouth and pharynx have both cilia and well-developed muscles.
807	3698	In other parts of the canal system, the gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to and furthest from the organ that it supplies.
807	3699	The nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles (internal compartments), germ cells that produce eggs or sperm, and photocytes that produce bioluminescence.
807	3700	The side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated cells that circulate water through the canals, punctuated by ciliary rosettes, pores that are surrounded by double whorls of cilia and connect to the mesoglea.
808	3701	The outer surface bears usually eight comb rows, called swimming-plates, which are used for swimming.
808	3702	The rows are oriented to run from near the mouth (the "oral pole") to the opposite end (the "aboral pole"), and are spaced more or less evenly around the body, although spacing patterns vary by species and in most species the comb rows extend only part of the distance from the aboral pole towards the mouth.
808	3703	The "combs" (also called "ctenes" or "comb plates") run across each row, and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia, up to 2 millimeters (0.079 in).
808	3704	Unlike conventional cilia and flagella, which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern, these cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern, where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function.
808	3705	These normally beat so that the propulsion stroke is away from the mouth, although they can also reverse direction.
808	3706	Hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is pointing, unlike jellyfish.
808	3707	When trying to escape predators, one species can accelerate to six times its normal speed; some other species reverse direction as part of their escape behavior, by reversing the power stroke of the comb plate cilia.
809	3708	It is uncertain how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but experiments have shown that some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities.
809	3709	Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater.
809	3710	If they enter less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density, to avoid sinking.
809	3711	Conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater, the rosettes may pump water out of the mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density.
810	3712	The largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ (at the opposite end from the mouth).
810	3713	Its main component is a statocyst, a balance sensor consisting of a statolith, a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia, called "balancers", that sense its orientation.
810	3714	The statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long, immobile cilia.
810	3715	A ctenophore does not automatically try to keep the statolith resting equally on all the balancers.
810	3716	Instead its response is determined by the animal's "mood", in other words the overall state of the nervous system.
810	3717	For example, if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey, it will often put some comb rows into reverse, spinning the mouth towards the prey.
811	3718	Cydippid ctenophores have bodies that are more or less rounded, sometimes nearly spherical and other times more cylindrical or egg-shaped; the common coastal "sea gooseberry," Pleurobrachia, sometimes has an egg-shaped body with the mouth at the narrow end, although some individuals are more uniformly round.
811	3719	From opposite sides of the body extends a pair of long, slender tentacles, each housed in a sheath into which it can be withdrawn.
811	3720	Some species of cydippids have bodies that are flattened to various extents, so that they are wider in the plane of the tentacles.
812	3721	The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles"), although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches.
812	3722	The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it.
812	3723	Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk.
812	3724	The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart.
812	3725	In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense.
812	3726	The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed.
812	3727	Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey.
812	3728	The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle.
812	3729	The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type.
812	3730	Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.
813	3731	There are eight rows of combs that run from near the mouth to the opposite end, and are spaced evenly round the body.
813	3732	The "combs" beat in a metachronal rhythm rather like that of a Mexican wave.
813	3733	From each balancer in the statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under the dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows, and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows.
813	3734	This forms a mechanical system for transmitting the beat rhythm from the combs to the balancers, via water disturbances created by the cilia.
814	3735	The Lobata have a pair of lobes, which are muscular, cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth.
814	3736	Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth, running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida).
814	3737	Between the lobes on either side of the mouth, many species of lobates have four auricles, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth.
814	3738	This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.
815	3739	Lobates have eight comb-rows, originating at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond the body to the lobes; in species with (four) auricles, the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia in four of the comb rows.
815	3740	Most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water, using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion, although Leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion.
815	3741	Members of the lobate genera Bathocyroe and Ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes, so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly.
815	3742	Unlike cydippids, the movements of lobates' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia, yet combs on the same row beat in the same Mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids.
815	3743	This may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egg-like.
816	3744	The Beroida, also known as Nuda, have no feeding appendages, but their large pharynx, just inside the large mouth and filling most of the saclike body, bears "macrocilia" at the oral end.
816	3745	These fused bundles of several thousand large cilia are able to "bite" off pieces of prey that are too large to swallow whole – almost always other ctenophores.
816	3746	In front of the field of macrocilia, on the mouth "lips" in some species of Beroe, is a pair of narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells on the stomach wall that "zip" the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding, by forming intercellular connections with the opposite adhesive strip.
816	3747	This tight closure streamlines the front of the animal when it is pursuing prey.
817	3748	The Cestida ("belt animals") are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals, with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon.
817	3749	There is a pair of comb-rows along each aboral edge, and tentilla emerging from a groove all along the oral edge, which stream back across most of the wing-like body surface.
817	3750	Cestids can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their comb-rows.
817	3751	There are two known species, with worldwide distribution in warm, and warm-temperate waters: Cestum veneris ("Venus' girdle") is among the largest ctenophores – up to 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) long, and can undulate slowly or quite rapidly.
817	3752	Velamen parallelum, which is typically less than 20 centimeters (0.66 ft) long, can move much faster in what has been described as a "darting motion".
818	3753	Most Platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the oral-aboral direction, with a pair of tentilla-bearing tentacles on the aboral surface.
818	3754	They cling to and creep on surfaces by everting the pharynx and using it as a muscular "foot".
818	3755	All but one of the known platyctenid species lack comb-rows.
818	3756	Platyctenids are usually cryptically colored, live on rocks, algae, or the body surfaces of other invertebrates, and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many sidebranches, seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore into the current.
819	3757	Almost all species are hermaphrodites, in other words they function as both males and females at the same time – except that in two species of the genus Ocryopsis individuals remain of the same single sex all their lives.
819	3758	The gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis.
819	3759	Fertilization is external in most species, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch.
819	3760	Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.
820	3761	Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, in other words there is no distinctive larval form, and juveniles of all groups generally resemble miniature cydippid adults.
820	3762	In the genus Beroe the juveniles, like the adults, lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths.
820	3763	In most species the juveniles gradually develop the body forms of their parents.
820	3764	In some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis, after dropping to the sea-floor.
821	3765	When some species, including Bathyctena chuni, Euplokamis stationis and Eurhamphaea vexilligera, are disturbed, they produce secretions (ink) that luminesce at much the same wavelengths as their bodies.
821	3766	Juveniles will luminesce more brightly in relation to their body size than adults, whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies.
821	3767	Detailed statistical investigation has not suggested the function of ctenophores' bioluminescence nor produced any correlation between its exact color and any aspect of the animals' environments, such as depth or whether they live in coastal or mid-ocean waters.
822	3768	Almost all ctenophores are predators – there are no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic.
822	3769	If food is plentiful, they can eat 10 times their own weight per day.
822	3770	While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores, other surface-water species prey on zooplankton (planktonic animals) ranging in size from the microscopic, including mollusc and fish larvae, to small adult crustaceans such as copepods, amphipods, and even krill.
822	3771	Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts.
822	3772	Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey – some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as "webs", some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders, and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread, as bolas spiders do.
822	3773	This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species.
822	3774	The two-tentacled "cydippid" Lampea feeds exclusively on salps, close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies, and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow.
822	3775	Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey: Pleurobrachia's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.
823	3776	Ctenophores used to be regarded as "dead ends" in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals.
823	3777	It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators, although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue.
823	3778	Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around.
823	3779	Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores.
823	3780	Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations.
823	3781	Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists, and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters.
823	3782	This is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the Red Sea.
823	3783	The larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores, as are the larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood.
824	3784	On the other hand, in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish.
824	3785	Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities.
824	3786	The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores.
824	3787	Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism.
824	3788	However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.
825	3789	Because of their soft, gelatinous bodies, ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils, and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstätten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue.
825	3790	Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period.
825	3791	Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period.
825	3792	All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species.
825	3793	They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores.
825	3794	One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular.
825	3795	Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species – for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes.
825	3796	The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly.
826	3797	The early Cambrian sessile frond-like fossil Stromatoveris, from China's Chengjiang lagerstätte and dated to about 515 million years ago, is very similar to Vendobionta of the preceding Ediacaran period.
826	3798	De-Gan Shu, Simon Conway Morris et al.
826	3799	found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia, used for filter feeding.
826	3800	They suggested that Stromatoveris was an evolutionary "aunt" of ctenophores, and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system.
827	3801	The relationship of ctenophores to the rest of Metazoa is very important to our understanding of the early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity.
827	3802	It has been the focus of debate for many years.
827	3803	Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animal phyla.
827	3804	A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla.
827	3805	Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals.
827	3806	This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage.
827	3807	However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead.
827	3808	Ctenophores and sponges are also the only known animal phyla that lack any true hox genes.
828	3809	Since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae, it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids, having an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles.
828	3810	Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid.
828	3811	Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids.
828	3812	He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like.
828	3813	A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like.
828	3814	It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small – so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain.
828	3815	This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished.
828	3816	When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain.
829	3817	Fresno (/ˈfrɛznoʊ/ FREZ-noh), the county seat of Fresno County, is a city in the U.S. state of California.
829	3818	As of 2015, the city's population was 520,159, making it the fifth-largest city in California, the largest inland city in California and the 34th-largest in the nation.
829	3819	Fresno is in the center of the San Joaquin Valley and is the largest city in the Central Valley, which contains the San Joaquin Valley.
829	3820	It is approximately 220 miles (350 km) northwest of Los Angeles, 170 miles (270 km) south of the state capital, Sacramento, or 185 miles (300 km) south of San Francisco.
829	3821	The name Fresno means "ash tree" in Spanish, and an ash leaf is featured on the city's flag.
830	3822	In 1872, the Central Pacific Railroad established a station near Easterby's—by now a hugely productive wheat farm—for its new Southern Pacific line.
830	3823	Soon there was a store around the station and the store grew the town of Fresno Station, later called Fresno.
830	3824	Many Millerton residents, drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding, moved to the new community.
830	3825	Fresno became an incorporated city in 1885.
830	3826	By 1931 the Fresno Traction Company operated 47 streetcars over 49 miles of track.
831	3827	Before World War II, Fresno had many ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Armenia, German Town, Little Italy, and Chinatown.
831	3828	In 1940, the Census Bureau reported Fresno's population as 94.0% white, 3.3% black and 2.7% Asian.
831	3829	(Incongruously, Chinatown was primarily a Japanese neighborhood and today Japanese-American businesses still remain).
831	3830	During 1942, Pinedale, in what is now North Fresno, was the site of the Pinedale Assembly Center, an interim facility for the relocation of Fresno area Japanese Americans to internment camps.
831	3831	The Fresno Fairgrounds was also utilized as an assembly center.
832	3832	In September 1958, Bank of America launched a new product called BankAmericard in Fresno.
832	3833	After a troubled gestation during which its creator resigned, BankAmericard went on to become the first successful credit card; that is, a financial instrument that was usable across a large number of merchants and also allowed cardholders to revolve a balance (earlier financial products could do one or the other but not both).
832	3834	In 1976, BankAmericard was renamed and spun off into a separate company known today as Visa Inc.
833	3835	In the 1970s, the city was the subject of a song, "Walking Into Fresno", written by Hall Of Fame guitarist Bill Aken and recorded by Bob Gallion of the world-famous "WWVA Jamboree" radio and television show in Wheeling, West Virginia.
833	3836	Aken, adopted by Mexican movie actress Lupe Mayorga, grew up in the neighboring town of Madera and his song chronicled the hardships faced by the migrant farm workers he saw as a child.
833	3837	Aken also made his first TV appearance playing guitar on the old country-western show at The Fresno Barn.
834	3838	Fresno has three large public parks, two in the city limits and one in county land to the southwest.
834	3839	Woodward Park, which features the Shinzen Japanese Gardens, numerous picnic areas and several miles of trails, is in North Fresno and is adjacent to the San Joaquin River Parkway.
834	3840	Roeding Park, near Downtown Fresno, is home to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo, and Rotary Storyland and Playland.
834	3841	Kearney Park is the largest of the Fresno region's park system and is home to historic Kearney Mansion and plays host to the annual Civil War Revisited, the largest reenactment of the Civil War in the west coast of the U.S.
835	3842	Between the 1880s and World War II, Downtown Fresno flourished, filled with electric Street Cars, and contained some of the San Joaquin Valley's most beautiful architectural buildings.
835	3843	Among them, the original Fresno County Courthouse (demolished), the Fresno Carnegie Public Library (demolished), the Fresno Water Tower, the Bank of Italy Building, the Pacific Southwest Building, the San Joaquin Light & Power Building (currently known as the Grand 1401), and the Hughes Hotel (burned down), to name a few.
836	3844	Fulton Street in Downtown Fresno was Fresno's main financial and commercial district before being converted into one of the nation's first pedestrian malls in 1964.
836	3845	Renamed the Fulton Mall, the area contains the densest collection of historic buildings in Fresno.
836	3846	While the Fulton Mall corridor has suffered a sharp decline from its heyday, the Mall includes some of the finest public art pieces in the country, including the only Pierre-Auguste Renoir piece in the world that one can walk up to and touch.
836	3847	Current plans call for the reopening of the Fulton Mall to automobile traffic.
836	3848	The public art pieces will be restored and placed near their current locations and will feature wide sidewalks (up to 28' on the east side of the street) to continue with the pedestrian friendly environment of the district.
837	3849	The neighborhood of Sunnyside is on Fresno's far southeast side, bounded by Chestnut Avenue to the West.
837	3850	Its major thoroughfares are Kings Canyon Avenue and Clovis Avenue.
837	3851	Although parts of Sunnyside are within the City of Fresno, much of the neighborhood is a "county island" within Fresno County.
837	3852	Largely developed in the 1950s through the 1970s, it has recently experienced a surge in new home construction.
837	3853	It is also the home of the Sunnyside Country Club, which maintains a golf course designed by William P. Bell.
838	3854	The popular neighborhood known as the Tower District is centered around the historic Tower Theatre, which is included on the National List of Historic Places.
838	3855	The theater was built in 1939 and is at Olive and Wishon Avenues in the heart of the Tower District.
838	3856	(The name of the theater refers to a well-known landmark water tower, which is actually in another nearby area).
838	3857	The Tower District neighborhood is just north of downtown Fresno proper, and one-half mile south of Fresno City College.
838	3858	Although the neighborhood was known as a residential area prior, the early commercial establishments of the Tower District began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after World War II.
838	3859	The character of small local businesses largely remains today.
838	3860	To some extent, the businesses of the Tower District were developed due to the proximity of the original Fresno Normal School, (later renamed California State University at Fresno).
838	3861	In 1916 the college moved to what is now the site of Fresno City College one-half mile north of the Tower District.
839	3862	This vibrant and culturally diverse area of retail businesses and residences experienced a renewal after a significant decline in the late 1960s and 1970s.
839	3863	[citation needed] After decades of neglect and suburban flight, the neighborhood revival followed the re-opening of the Tower Theatre in the late 1970s, which at that time showed second and third run movies, along with classic films.
839	3864	Roger Rocka's Dinner Theater & Good Company Players also opened nearby in 1978,[citation needed] at Olive and Wishon Avenues.
839	3865	Fresno native Audra McDonald performed in the leading roles of Evita and The Wiz at the theater while she was a high school student.
839	3866	McDonald subsequently became a leading performer on Broadway in New York City and a Tony award winning actress.
839	3867	Also in the Tower District is Good Company Players' 2nd Space Theatre.
840	3868	The neighborhood features restaurants, live theater and nightclubs, as well as several independent shops and bookstores, currently operating on or near Olive Avenue, and all within a few hundred feet of each other.
840	3869	Since renewal, the Tower District has become an attractive area for restaurant and other local businesses.
840	3870	Today, the Tower District is also known as the center of Fresno's LGBT and hipster Communities.
840	3871	; Additionally, Tower District is also known as the center of Fresno's local punk/goth/deathrock and heavy metal community.
841	3872	The area is also known for its early twentieth century homes, many of which have been restored in recent decades.
841	3873	The area includes many California Bungalow and American Craftsman style homes, Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture, Mediterranean Revival Style architecture, Mission Revival Style architecture, and many Storybook houses designed by Fresno architects, Hilliard, Taylor & Wheeler.
841	3874	The residential architecture of the Tower District contrasts with the newer areas of tract homes urban sprawl in north and east areas of Fresno.
842	3875	Homes from the early 20th century line this boulevard in the heart of the historic Alta Vista Tract.
842	3876	The section of Huntington Boulevard between First Street on the west to Cedar Avenue on the east is the home to many large, stately homes.
842	3877	The original development of this area began circa 1910, on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field.
842	3878	The Alta Vista Tract, as the land would become known, was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, and was officially platted in 1911.
842	3879	The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west.
842	3880	The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community.
842	3881	At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon.
842	3882	In 1914 developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor.
842	3883	A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes.
842	3884	This rapid development was no doubt hastened by the Fresno Traction Company right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard, which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the County Hospital.
843	3885	The "West Side" of Fresno, also often called "Southwest Fresno", is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city.
843	3886	The neighborhood lies southwest of the 99 freeway (which divides it from Downtown Fresno), west of the 41 freeway and south of Nielsen Ave (or the newly constructed 180 Freeway), and extends to the city limits to the west and south.
843	3887	The neighborhood is traditionally considered to be the center of Fresno's African-American community.
843	3888	It is culturally diverse and also includes significant Mexican-American and Asian-American (principally Hmong or Laotian) populations.
844	3889	The neighborhood includes Kearney Boulevard, named after early 20th century entrepreneur and millionaire M. Theo Kearney, which extends from Fresno Street in Southwest Fresno about 20 mi (32 km) west to Kerman, California.
844	3890	A small, two-lane rural road for most of its length, Kearney Boulevard is lined with tall palm trees.
844	3891	The roughly half-mile stretch of Kearney Boulevard between Fresno Street and Thorne Ave was at one time the preferred neighborhood for Fresno's elite African-American families.
844	3892	Another section, Brookhaven, on the southern edge of the West Side south of Jensen and west of Elm, was given the name by the Fresno City Council in an effort to revitalize the neighborhood's image.
844	3893	The isolated subdivision was for years known as the "Dogg Pound" in reference to a local gang, and as of late 2008 was still known for high levels of violent crime.
845	3894	While many homes in the neighborhood date back to the 1930s or before, the neighborhood is also home to several public housing developments built between the 1960s and 1990s by the Fresno Housing Authority.
845	3895	The US Department of Housing and Urban Development has also built small subdivisions of single-family homes in the area for purchase by low-income working families.
845	3896	There have been numerous attempts to revitalize the neighborhood, including the construction of a modern shopping center on the corner of Fresno and B streets, an aborted attempt to build luxury homes and a golf course on the western edge of the neighborhood, and some new section 8 apartments have been built along Church Ave west of Elm St. Cargill Meat Solutions and Foster Farms both have large processing facilities in the neighborhood, and the stench from these (and other small industrial facilities) has long plagued area residents.
845	3897	The Fresno Chandler Executive Airport is also on the West Side.
845	3898	Due to its position on the edge of the city and years of neglect by developers, is not a true "inner-city" neighborhood, and there are many vacant lots, strawberry fields and vineyards throughout the neighborhood.
845	3899	The neighborhood has very little retail activity, aside from the area near Fresno Street and State Route 99 Freeway (Kearney Palm Shopping Center, built in the late 1990s) and small corner markets scattered throughout.
846	3900	In the north eastern part of Fresno, Woodward Park was founded by the late Ralph Woodward, a long-time Fresno resident.
846	3901	He bequeathed a major portion of his estate in 1968 to provide a regional park and bird sanctuary in Northeast Fresno.
846	3902	The park lies on the South bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway 41 and Friant Road.
846	3903	The initial 235 acres (0.95 km2), combined with additional acres acquired later by the City, brings the park to a sizable 300 acres (1.2 km2).
846	3904	Now packed with amenities, Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size in the Central Valley.
846	3905	The Southeast corner of the park harbors numerous bird species offering bird enthusiasts an excellent opportunity for viewing.
846	3906	The park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people, authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, two-mile (3 km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, 3 small ponds, 7 picnic areas and five miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S. Eaton Trail.
846	3907	When complete, the Lewis S. Eaton trail system will cover 22 miles (35 km) between Highway 99 and Friant Dam.
846	3908	The park's numerous picnic tables make for a great picnic destination and a convenient escape from city life.
846	3909	The park's amphetheatre was renovated in 2010, and has hosted performances by acts such as Deftones, Tech N9ne, and Sevendust as well as numerous others.
846	3910	The park is open April through October, 6am to 10pm and November through March, 6am to 7pm.
846	3911	Woodward Park is home to the annual CIF(California Interscholastic Federation) State Championship cross country meet, which takes place in late November.
846	3912	It is also the home of the Woodward Shakespeare Festival which began performances in the park in 2005.
847	3913	Formed in 1946, Sierra Sky Park Airport is a residential airport community born of a unique agreement in transportation law to allow personal aircraft and automobiles to share certain roads.
847	3914	Sierra Sky Park was the first aviation community to be built[citation needed] and there are now numerous such communities across the United States and around the world.
847	3915	Developer William Smilie created the nation's first planned aviation community.
847	3916	Still in operation today, the public use airport provides a unique neighborhood that spawned interest and similar communities nationwide.
848	3917	Fresno is marked by a semi-arid climate (Köppen BSh), with mild, moist winters and hot and dry summers, thus displaying Mediterranean characteristics.
848	3918	December and January are the coldest months, and average around 46.5 °F (8.1 °C), and there are 14 nights with freezing lows annually, with the coldest night of the year typically bottoming out below 30 °F (−1.1 °C).
848	3919	July is the warmest month, averaging 83.0 °F (28.3 °C); normally, there are 32 days of 100 °F (37.8 °C)+ highs and 106 days of 90 °F (32.2 °C)+ highs, and in July and August, there are only three or four days where the high does not reach 90 °F (32.2 °C).
848	3920	Summers provide considerable sunshine, with July peaking at 97 percent of the total possible sunlight hours; conversely, January is the lowest with only 46 percent of the daylight time in sunlight because of thick tule fog.
848	3921	However, the year averages 81% of possible sunshine, for a total of 3550 hours.
848	3922	Average annual precipitation is around 11.5 inches (292.1 mm), which, by definition, would classify the area as a semidesert.
848	3923	Most of the wind rose direction occurrences derive from the northwest, as winds are driven downward along the axis of the California Central Valley; in December, January and February there is an increased presence of southeastern wind directions in the wind rose statistics.
848	3924	Fresno meteorology was selected in a national U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study for analysis of equilibrium temperature for use of ten-year meteorological data to represent a warm, dry western United States locale.
849	3925	The official record high temperature for Fresno is 115 °F (46.1 °C), set on July 8, 1905, while the official record low is 17 °F (−8 °C), set on January 6, 1913.
849	3926	The average windows for 100 °F (37.8 °C)+, 90 °F (32.2 °C)+, and freezing temperatures are June 1 thru September 13, April 26 thru October 9, and December 10 thru January 28, respectively, and no freeze occurred between in the 1983/1984 season.
849	3927	Annual rainfall has ranged from 23.57 inches (598.7 mm) in the “rain year” from July 1982 to June 1983 down to 4.43 inches (112.5 mm) from July 1933 to June 1934.
849	3928	The most rainfall in one month was 9.54 inches (242.3 mm) in November 1885 and the most rainfall in 24 hours 3.55 inches (90.2 mm) on November 18, 1885.
849	3929	Measurable precipitation falls on an average of 48 days annually.
849	3930	Snow is a rarity; the heaviest snowfall at the airport was 2.2 inches (0.06 m) on January 21, 1962.
850	3931	The 2010 United States Census reported that Fresno had a population of 494,665.
850	3932	The population density was 4,404.5 people per square mile (1,700.6/km²).
850	3933	The racial makeup of Fresno was 245,306 (49.6%) White, 40,960 (8.3%) African American, 8,525 (1.7%) Native American, 62,528 (12.6%) Asian (3.6% Hmong, 1.7% Indian, 1.2% Filipino, 1.2% Laotian, 1.0% Thai, 0.8% Cambodian, 0.7% Chinese, 0.5% Japanese, 0.4% Vietnamese, 0.2% Korean), 849 (0.2%) Pacific Islander, 111,984 (22.6%) from other races, and 24,513 (5.0%) from two or more races.
850	3934	Hispanic or Latino of any race were 232,055 persons (46.9%).
850	3935	Among the Hispanic population, 42.7% of the total population are Mexican, 0.4% Salvadoran, and 0.4% Puerto Rican.
850	3936	Non-Hispanic Whites were 30.0% of the population in 2010, down from 72.6% in 1970.
851	3937	There were 158,349 households, of which 68,511 (43.3%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 69,284 (43.8%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 30,547 (19.3%) had a female householder with no husband present, 11,698 (7.4%) had a male householder with no wife present.
851	3938	There were 12,843 (8.1%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 1,388 (0.9%) same-sex married couples or partnerships.
851	3939	35,064 households (22.1%) were made up of individuals and 12,344 (7.8%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.
851	3940	The average household size was 3.07.
851	3941	There were 111,529 families (70.4% of all households); the average family size was 3.62.
852	3942	As of the census of 2000, there were 427,652 people, 140,079 households, and 97,915 families residing in the city.
852	3943	The population density was 4,097.9 people per square mile (1,582.2/km²).
852	3944	There were 149,025 housing units at an average density of 1,427.9 square miles (3,698 km2).
852	3945	The racial makeup of the city was 50.2% White, 8.4% Black or African American, 1.6% Native American, 11.2% Asian (about a third of which is Hmong), 0.1% Pacific Islander, 23.4% from other races, and 5.2% from two or more races.
852	3946	Hispanic or Latino of any race were 39.9% of the population.
853	3947	To avoid interference with existing VHF television stations in the San Francisco Bay Area and those planned for Chico, Sacramento, Salinas, and Stockton, the Federal Communications Commission decided that Fresno would only have UHF television stations.
853	3948	The very first Fresno television station to begin broadcasting was KMJ-TV, which debuted on June 1, 1953.
853	3949	KMJ is now known as NBC affiliate KSEE.
853	3950	Other Fresno stations include ABC O&O KFSN, CBS affiliate KGPE, CW affiliate KFRE, FOX affiliate KMPH, MNTV affiliate KAIL, PBS affiliate KVPT, Telemundo O&O KNSO, Univision O&O KFTV, and MundoFox and Azteca affiliate KGMC-DT.
854	3951	Fresno is served by State Route 99, the main north/south freeway that connects the major population centers of the California Central Valley.
854	3952	State Route 168, the Sierra Freeway, heads east to the city of Clovis and Huntington Lake.
854	3953	State Route 41 (Yosemite Freeway/Eisenhower Freeway) comes into Fresno from Atascadero in the south, and then heads north to Yosemite.
854	3954	State Route 180 (Kings Canyon Freeway) comes from the west via Mendota, and from the east in Kings Canyon National Park going towards the city of Reedley.
855	3955	Fresno is the largest U.S. city not directly linked to an Interstate highway.
855	3956	When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, the decision was made to build what is now Interstate 5 on the west side of the Central Valley, and thus bypass many of the population centers in the region, instead of upgrading what is now State Route 99.
855	3957	Due to rapidly raising population and traffic in cities along SR 99, as well as the desirability of Federal funding, much discussion has been made to upgrade it to interstate standards and eventually incorporate it into the interstate system, most likely as Interstate 9.
855	3958	Major improvements to signage, lane width, median separation, vertical clearance, and other concerns are currently underway.
856	3959	Passenger rail service is provided by Amtrak San Joaquins.
856	3960	The main passenger rail station is the recently renovated historic Santa Fe Railroad Depot in Downtown Fresno.
856	3961	The Bakersfield-Stockton mainlines of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway and Union Pacific Railroad railroads cross in Fresno, and both railroads maintain railyards within the city; the San Joaquin Valley Railroad also operates former Southern Pacific branchlines heading west and south out of the city.
856	3962	The city of Fresno is planned to serve the future California High Speed Rail.
857	3963	Starting in the late 1950s, American computer scientist Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching with the goal to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages as part of a research program at the RAND Corporation, funded by the US Department of Defense.
857	3964	This concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth, largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in the Bell System.
857	3965	The new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) (NPL) in the late 1960s.
857	3966	Davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe in the decade following, including the incorporation of the concept in the early ARPANET in the United States.
858	3967	Packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm, circuit switching, a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes.
858	3968	In cases of billable services, such as cellular communication services, circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time, even when no data is transferred, while packet switching may be characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted, such as characters, packets, or messages.
859	3969	Packet mode communication may be implemented with or without intermediate forwarding nodes (packet switches or routers).
859	3970	Packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering, but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing, traffic shaping, or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service, such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket.
859	3971	In case of a shared physical medium (such as radio or 10BASE5), the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme.
860	3972	Baran developed the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching during his research at the RAND Corporation for the US Air Force into survivable communications networks, first presented to the Air Force in the summer of 1961 as briefing B-265, later published as RAND report P-2626 in 1962, and finally in report RM 3420 in 1964.
860	3973	Report P-2626 described a general architecture for a large-scale, distributed, survivable communications network.
860	3974	The work focuses on three key ideas: use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points, dividing user messages into message blocks, later called packets, and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.
861	3975	Starting in 1965, Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory, UK, independently developed the same message routing methodology as developed by Baran.
861	3976	He called it packet switching, a more accessible name than Baran's, and proposed to build a nationwide network in the UK.
861	3977	He gave a talk on the proposal in 1966, after which a person from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) told him about Baran's work.
861	3978	A member of Davies' team (Roger Scantlebury) met Lawrence Roberts at the 1967 ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles and suggested it for use in the ARPANET.
862	3979	In connectionless mode each packet includes complete addressing information.
862	3980	The packets are routed individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery.
862	3981	Each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers.
862	3982	It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet.
862	3983	This precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination, but means that much more information is needed in the packet header, which is therefore larger, and this information needs to be looked up in power-hungry content-addressable memory.
862	3984	Each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes; potentially, the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection-oriented system has to do in connection set-up, but with less information as to the application's requirements.
862	3985	At the destination, the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence number.
862	3986	Thus a virtual connection, also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream is provided to the end-user by a transport layer protocol, although intermediate network nodes only provides a connectionless network layer service.
863	3987	Connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication.
863	3988	The packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking.
863	3989	Address information is only transferred to each node during the connection set-up phase, when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes.
863	3990	The signaling protocols used allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters.
863	3991	Acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated.
863	3992	Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table.
863	3993	The packet header can be small, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number, which is different for different packets.
864	3994	ARPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969.
864	3995	Before the introduction of X.25 in 1973, about twenty different network technologies had been developed.
864	3996	Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core.
864	3997	In the datagram system, the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets.
864	3998	The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is an example of a datagram protocol.
864	3999	In the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host.
864	4000	This results in a simpler host interface with less functionality than in the datagram model.
864	4001	The X.25 protocol suite uses this network type.
865	4002	AppleTalk was a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by Apple Inc. in 1985 for Apple Macintosh computers.
865	4003	It was the primary protocol used by Apple devices through the 1980s and 90s.
865	4004	AppleTalk included features that allowed local area networks to be established ad hoc without the requirement for a centralized router or server.
865	4005	The AppleTalk system automatically assigned addresses, updated the distributed namespace, and configured any required inter-network routing.
866	4006	The CYCLADES packet switching network was a French research network designed and directed by Louis Pouzin.
866	4007	First demonstrated in 1973, it was developed to explore alternatives to the early ARPANET design and to support network research generally.
866	4008	It was the first network to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data, rather than the network itself, using unreliable datagrams and associated end-to-end protocol mechanisms.
866	4009	Concepts of this network influenced later ARPANET architecture.
867	4010	DECnet is a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation, originally released in 1975 in order to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers.
867	4011	It evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s.
867	4012	Initially built with three layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol.
867	4013	The DECnet protocols were designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation.
867	4014	However, DECnet Phase II (and later) were open standards with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside DEC, including one for Linux.
868	4015	In 1965, at the instigation of Warner Sinback, a data network based on this voice-phone network was designed to connect GE's four computer sales and service centers (Schenectady, Phoenix, Chicago, and Phoenix) to facilitate a computer time-sharing service, apparently the world's first commercial online service.
868	4016	(In addition to selling GE computers, the centers were computer service bureaus, offering batch processing services.
868	4017	They lost money from the beginning, and Sinback, a high-level marketing manager, was given the job of turning the business around.
868	4018	He decided that a time-sharing system, based on Kemney's work at Dartmouth—which used a computer on loan from GE—could be profitable.
869	4019	Merit Network, Inc., an independent non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation governed by Michigan's public universities, was formed in 1966 as the Michigan Educational Research Information Triad to explore computer networking between three of Michigan's public universities as a means to help the state's educational and economic development.
869	4020	With initial support from the State of Michigan and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the packet-switched network was first demonstrated in December 1971 when an interactive host to host connection was made between the IBM mainframe computer systems at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Wayne State University in Detroit.
869	4021	In October 1972 connections to the CDC mainframe at Michigan State University in East Lansing completed the triad.
869	4022	Over the next several years in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal to host connections, host to host batch connections (remote job submission, remote printing, batch file transfer), interactive file transfer, gateways to the Tymnet and Telenet public data networks, X.25 host attachments, gateways to X.25 data networks, Ethernet attached hosts, and eventually TCP/IP and additional public universities in Michigan join the network.
869	4023	All of this set the stage for Merit's role in the NSFNET project starting in the mid-1980s.
870	4024	Telenet was the first FCC-licensed public data network in the United States.
870	4025	It was founded by former ARPA IPTO director Larry Roberts as a means of making ARPANET technology public.
870	4026	He had tried to interest AT&T in buying the technology, but the monopoly's reaction was that this was incompatible with their future.
870	4027	Bolt, Beranack and Newman (BBN) provided the financing.
870	4028	It initially used ARPANET technology but changed the host interface to X.25 and the terminal interface to X.29.
870	4029	Telenet designed these protocols and helped standardize them in the CCITT.
870	4030	Telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975.
870	4031	It went public in 1979 and was then sold to GTE.
871	4032	Tymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in San Jose, CA that utilized virtual call packet switched technology and used X.25, SNA/SDLC, BSC and ASCII interfaces to connect host computers (servers)at thousands of large companies, educational institutions, and government agencies.
871	4033	Users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated async connections.
871	4034	The business consisted of a large public network that supported dial-up users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies (mostly banks and airlines) to build their own dedicated networks.
871	4035	The private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network.
871	4036	Tymnet was also connected to dozens of other public networks in the U.S. and internationally via X.25/X.75 gateways.
871	4037	(Interesting note: Tymnet was not named after Mr. Tyme.
872	4038	There were two kinds of X.25 networks.
872	4039	Some such as DATAPAC and TRANSPAC were initially implemented with an X.25 external interface.
872	4040	Some older networks such as TELENET and TYMNET were modified to provide a X.25 host interface in addition to older host connection schemes.
872	4041	DATAPAC was developed by Bell Northern Research which was a joint venture of Bell Canada (a common carrier) and Northern Telecom (a telecommunications equipment supplier).
872	4042	Northern Telecom sold several DATAPAC clones to foreign PTTs including the Deutsche Bundespost.
872	4043	X.75 and X.121 allowed the interconnection of national X.25 networks.
872	4044	A user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the DNIC of the remote network as part of the destination address.
873	4045	AUSTPAC was an Australian public X.25 network operated by Telstra.
873	4046	Started by Telecom Australia in the early 1980s, AUSTPAC was Australia's first public packet-switched data network, supporting applications such as on-line betting, financial applications — the Australian Tax Office made use of AUSTPAC — and remote terminal access to academic institutions, who maintained their connections to AUSTPAC up until the mid-late 1990s in some cases.
873	4047	Access can be via a dial-up terminal to a PAD, or, by linking a permanent X.25 node to the network.
874	4048	Datanet 1 was the public switched data network operated by the Dutch PTT Telecom (now known as KPN).
874	4049	Strictly speaking Datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines (using the X.121 DNIC 2041), the name also referred to the public PAD service Telepad (using the DNIC 2049).
874	4050	And because the main Videotex service used the network and modified PAD devices as infrastructure the name Datanet 1 was used for these services as well.
874	4051	Although this use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed by the same people within one department of KPN contributed to the confusion.
875	4052	The Computer Science Network (CSNET) was a computer network funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) that began operation in 1981.
875	4053	Its purpose was to extend networking benefits, for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to ARPANET, due to funding or authorization limitations.
875	4054	It played a significant role in spreading awareness of, and access to, national networking and was a major milestone on the path to development of the global Internet.
876	4055	Internet2 is a not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities, industry, and government.
876	4056	The Internet2 community, in partnership with Qwest, built the first Internet2 Network, called Abilene, in 1998 and was a prime investor in the National LambdaRail (NLR) project.
876	4057	In 2006, Internet2 announced a partnership with Level 3 Communications to launch a brand new nationwide network, boosting its capacity from 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s.
876	4058	In October, 2007, Internet2 officially retired Abilene and now refers to its new, higher capacity network as the Internet2 Network.
877	4059	The National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) was a program of coordinated, evolving projects sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) beginning in 1985 to promote advanced research and education networking in the United States.
877	4060	NSFNET was also the name given to several nationwide backbone networks operating at speeds of 56 kbit/s, 1.5 Mbit/s (T1), and 45 Mbit/s (T3) that were constructed to support NSF's networking initiatives from 1985-1995.
877	4061	Initially created to link researchers to the nation's NSF-funded supercomputing centers, through further public funding and private industry partnerships it developed into a major part of the Internet backbone.
878	4062	The Very high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) came on line in April 1995 as part of a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored project to provide high-speed interconnection between NSF-sponsored supercomputing centers and select access points in the United States.
878	4063	The network was engineered and operated by MCI Telecommunications under a cooperative agreement with the NSF.
878	4064	By 1998, the vBNS had grown to connect more than 100 universities and research and engineering institutions via 12 national points of presence with DS-3 (45 Mbit/s), OC-3c (155 Mbit/s), and OC-12c (622 Mbit/s) links on an all OC-12c backbone, a substantial engineering feat for that time.
878	4065	The vBNS installed one of the first ever production OC-48c (2.5 Gbit/s) IP links in February 1999 and went on to upgrade the entire backbone to OC-48c.
879	4066	The Black Death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of Central Asia, where it then travelled along the Silk Road, reaching Crimea by 1343.
879	4067	From there, it was most likely carried by Oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships.
879	4068	Spreading throughout the Mediterranean and Europe, the Black Death is estimated to have killed 30–60% of Europe's total population.
879	4069	In total, the plague reduced the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350–375 million in the 14th century.
879	4070	The world population as a whole did not recover to pre-plague levels until the 17th century.
879	4071	The plague recurred occasionally in Europe until the 19th century.
880	4072	The plague disease, caused by Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda.
880	4073	Nestorian graves dating to 1338–39 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India.
880	4074	In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China.
880	4075	In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading.
880	4076	However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century.
880	4077	In the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after.
880	4078	Epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years before it reached Constantinople in 1347.
881	4079	Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via Genoese traders at the port city of Kaffa in the Crimea in 1347.
881	4080	After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering from the disease, the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants.
881	4081	The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread north.
881	4082	Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death.
882	4083	From Italy, the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350.
882	4084	It was introduced in Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at Askøy, then spread to Bjørgvin (modern Bergen) and Iceland.
882	4085	Finally it spread to northwestern Russia in 1351.
882	4086	The plague was somewhat less common in parts of Europe that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours, including the Kingdom of Poland, the majority of the Basque Country, isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent.
883	4087	The plague struck various countries in the Middle East during the pandemic, leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures.
883	4088	As it spread to western Europe, the disease entered the region from southern Russia also.
883	4089	By autumn 1347, the plague reached Alexandria in Egypt, probably through the port's trade with Constantinople, and ports on the Black Sea.
883	4090	During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to Gaza, and north along the eastern coast to cities in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, including Ashkelon, Acre, Jerusalem, Sidon, Damascus, Homs, and Aleppo.
883	4091	In 1348–49, the disease reached Antioch.
883	4092	The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread to the people of Asia Minor.
884	4093	Gasquet (1908) claimed that the Latin name atra mors (Black Death) for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in modern times in 1631 in a book on Danish history by J.I.
884	4094	Pontanus: "Vulgo & ab effectu atram mortem vocatibant.
884	4095	("Commonly and from its effects, they called it the black death").
884	4096	The name spread through Scandinavia and then Germany, gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th-century epidemic as a proper name.
884	4097	In England, it was not until 1823 that the medieval epidemic was first called the Black Death.
885	4098	Medical knowledge had stagnated during the Middle Ages.
885	4099	The most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in Paris in a report to the king of France that blamed the heavens, in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a "great pestilence in the air".
885	4100	This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers.
885	4101	That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory.
885	4102	Today, this is known as the Miasma theory.
885	4103	The word 'plague' had no special significance at this time, and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term.
886	4104	The dominant explanation for the Black Death is the plague theory, which attributes the outbreak to Yersinia pestis, also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India.
886	4105	The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named Yersinia pestis.
886	4106	The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host.
886	4107	This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host.
886	4108	The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance.
886	4109	When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic.
887	4110	The historian Francis Aidan Gasquet wrote about the 'Great Pestilence' in 1893 and suggested that "it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague".
887	4111	He was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the Black Death for the second edition in 1908, implicating rats and fleas in the process, and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics, such as the Justinian plague that was prevalent in the Eastern Roman Empire from 541 to 700 CE.
888	4112	Other forms of plague have been implicated by modern scientists.
888	4113	The modern bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30–75% and symptoms including fever of 38–41 °C (100–106 °F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise.
888	4114	Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days.
888	4115	Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent.
888	4116	Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum.
888	4117	As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free flowing and bright red.
888	4118	Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%.
888	4119	Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation).
888	4120	In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.
889	4121	In October 2010, the open-access scientific journal PLoS Pathogens published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of Yersinia pestis in the Black Death following the disputed identification by Drancourt and Raoult in 1998.
889	4122	They assessed the presence of DNA/RNA with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques for Y. pestis from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences.
889	4123	The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany, ".
889	4124	ends the debate about the etiology of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that Y. pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages".
890	4125	The study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades (genetic branches) of the Y. pestis genome associated with medieval mass graves.
890	4126	These clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern Y. pestis strains Y. p. orientalis and Y. p. medievalis, suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves.
890	4127	Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of Marseille around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics.
890	4128	Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom showed the Y. pestis genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the Hanseatic cities or another site.
891	4129	The results of the Haensch study have since been confirmed and amended.
891	4130	Based on genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the East Smithfield burial site in England, Schuenemann et al.
891	4131	concluded in 2011 "that the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of Y. pestis that may no longer exist."
891	4132	A study published in Nature in October 2011 sequenced the genome of Y. pestis from plague victims and indicated that the strain that caused the Black Death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease.
892	4133	The plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J. F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.
892	4134	In 1984 zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors, including Samuel K. Cohn, Jr. (2002), David Herlihy (1997), and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan (2001).
893	4135	It is recognised that an epidemiological account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms, but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period.
893	4136	Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377.
893	4137	Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.
894	4138	In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves.
895	4139	A variety of alternatives to the Y. pestis have been put forward.
895	4140	Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics.
895	4141	Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola.
895	4142	Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person.
895	4143	However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance.
895	4144	Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections.
895	4145	In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of "blood poisoning") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.
895	4146	In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.
896	4147	The most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a death rate of about a third.
896	4148	The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypt's population.
896	4149	Half of Paris's population of 100,000 people died.
896	4150	In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110–120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351.
896	4151	At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well.
896	4152	Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time.
896	4153	Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450.
896	4154	In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished.
896	4155	In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die.
896	4156	The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion.
896	4157	Monks and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for victims of the Black Death.
897	4158	The plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries.
897	4159	According to Biraben, the plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671.
897	4160	The Second Pandemic was particularly widespread in the following years: 1360–63; 1374; 1400; 1438–39; 1456–57; 1464–66; 1481–85; 1500–03; 1518–31; 1544–48; 1563–66; 1573–88; 1596–99; 1602–11; 1623–40; 1644–54; and 1664–67.
897	4161	Subsequent outbreaks, though severe, marked the retreat from most of Europe (18th century) and northern Africa (19th century).
897	4162	According to Geoffrey Parker, "France alone lost almost a million people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628–31."
898	4163	In England, in the absence of census figures, historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300, and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million.
898	4164	By the end of 1350, the Black Death subsided, but it never really died out in England.
898	4165	Over the next few hundred years, further outbreaks occurred in 1361–62, 1369, 1379–83, 1389–93, and throughout the first half of the 15th century.
898	4166	An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10–15% of the population, while the death rate of the plague of 1479–80 could have been as high as 20%.
898	4167	The most general outbreaks in Tudor and Stuart England seem to have begun in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589, 1603, 1625, and 1636, and ended with the Great Plague of London in 1665.
899	4168	In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris.
899	4169	During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time.
899	4170	The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490.
899	4171	Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years.
899	4172	Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623–25, and again in 1635–36, 1655, and 1664.
899	4173	Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528.
899	4174	The plague of 1576–77 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population.
899	4175	Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679.
899	4176	Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348–50.
899	4177	The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.
900	4178	In the first half of the 17th century, a plague claimed some 1.7 million victims in Italy, or about 14% of the population.
900	4179	In 1656, the plague killed about half of Naples' 300,000 inhabitants.
900	4180	More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century Spain.
900	4181	The plague of 1649 probably reduced the population of Seville by half.
900	4182	In 1709–13, a plague epidemic that followed the Great Northern War (1700–21, Sweden v. Russia and allies) killed about 100,000 in Sweden, and 300,000 in Prussia.
900	4183	The plague killed two-thirds of the inhabitants of Helsinki, and claimed a third of Stockholm's population.
900	4184	Europe's last major epidemic occurred in 1720 in Marseille.
901	4185	The Black Death ravaged much of the Islamic world.
901	4186	Plague was present in at least one location in the Islamic world virtually every year between 1500 and 1850.
901	4187	Plague repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa.
901	4188	Algiers lost 30 to 50 thousand inhabitants to it in 1620–21, and again in 1654–57, 1665, 1691, and 1740–42.
901	4189	Plague remained a major event in Ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century.
901	4190	Between 1701 and 1750, thirty-seven larger and smaller epidemics were recorded in Constantinople, and an additional thirty-one between 1751 and 1800.
901	4191	Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague, and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out.
902	4192	There are three major types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.
902	4193	The rock cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock, and magma.
902	4194	When a rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava), it is an igneous rock.
902	4195	This rock can be weathered and eroded, and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock, or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric.
902	4196	The sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified, ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock.
902	4197	Sedimentary rock may also be re-eroded and redeposited, and metamorphic rock may also undergo additional metamorphism.
902	4198	All three types of rocks may be re-melted; when this happens, a new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize.
903	4199	In the 1960s, a series of discoveries, the most important of which was seafloor spreading, showed that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle, is separated into a number of tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere.
903	4200	There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle: oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction, because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle.
903	4201	This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics.
904	4202	The development of plate tectonics provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth.
904	4203	Long linear regions of geologic features could be explained as plate boundaries.
904	4204	Mid-ocean ridges, high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist, were explained as divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart.
904	4205	Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries, where one plate subducts under another.
904	4206	Transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas fault system, resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes.
904	4207	Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift, in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time.
904	4208	They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology.
904	4209	The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.
905	4210	Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth.
905	4211	Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core.
905	4212	These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that.
905	4213	More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan.
905	4214	These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.
906	4215	The following four timelines show the geologic time scale.
906	4216	The first shows the entire time from the formation of the Earth to the present, but this compresses the most recent eon.
906	4217	Therefore, the second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale.
906	4218	The second scale compresses the most recent era, so the most recent era is expanded in the third scale.
906	4219	Since the Quaternary is a very short period with short epochs, it is further expanded in the fourth scale.
906	4220	The second, third, and fourth timelines are therefore each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks.
906	4221	The Holocene (the latest epoch) is too small to be shown clearly on the third timeline on the right, another reason for expanding the fourth scale.
906	4222	Q stands for the Quaternary period.
907	4223	The principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut.
907	4224	Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault.
907	4225	Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.
908	4226	The principle of inclusions and components states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or clasts) are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them.
908	4227	For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer.
908	4228	A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found.
908	4229	These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix.
908	4230	As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them.
909	4231	The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks.
909	4232	As organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found.
909	4233	Based on principles laid out by William Smith almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought.
909	4234	The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time.
910	4235	At the beginning of the 20th century, important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods.
910	4236	This changed the understanding of geologic time.
910	4237	Previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another.
910	4238	With isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.
911	4239	For many geologic applications, isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature, the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice.
911	4240	These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies.
911	4241	Common methods include uranium-lead dating, potassium-argon dating, argon-argon dating and uranium-thorium dating.
911	4242	These methods are used for a variety of applications.
911	4243	Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques.
911	4244	These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement.
911	4245	Thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain ranges, and paleotopography.
912	4246	When rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker.
912	4247	Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding.
912	4248	In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock.
912	4249	Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones.
912	4250	Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault.
912	4251	Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting.
912	4252	These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating "antiforms", or where it buckles downwards, creating "synforms".
912	4253	If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively.
912	4254	If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms.
913	4255	Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner.
913	4256	This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning.
913	4257	Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower.
913	4258	This typically results in younger units being placed below older units.
913	4259	Stretching of units can result in their thinning; in fact, there is a location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter.
913	4260	Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed.
913	4261	These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses, known as boudins, after the French word for "sausage", because of their visual similarity.
914	4262	The addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation.
914	4263	Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels.
914	4264	These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down.
914	4265	Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit.
914	4266	Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity.
914	4267	Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below.
914	4268	Dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed.
914	4269	This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano.
915	4270	All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment, and do not necessarily occur in a single order.
915	4271	The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows.
915	4272	The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time.
915	4273	Other areas are much more geologically complex.
915	4274	In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded.
915	4275	Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis.
915	4276	In addition, these processes can occur in stages.
915	4277	In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited.
915	4278	Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.
916	4279	Geologists use a number of field, laboratory, and numerical modeling methods to decipher Earth history and understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth.
916	4280	In typical geological investigations, geologists use primary information related to petrology (the study of rocks), stratigraphy (the study of sedimentary layers), and structural geology (the study of positions of rock units and their deformation).
916	4281	In many cases, geologists also study modern soils, rivers, landscapes, and glaciers; investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways, and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface.
917	4282	In addition to identifying rocks in the field, petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory.
917	4283	Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe.
917	4284	In an optical mineralogy analysis, thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope, where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their birefringence, pleochroism, twinning, and interference properties with a conoscopic lens.
917	4285	In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals.
917	4286	Stable and radioactive isotope studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units.
918	4287	Petrologists can also use fluid inclusion data and perform high temperature and pressure physical experiments to understand the temperatures and pressures at which different mineral phases appear, and how they change through igneous and metamorphic processes.
918	4288	This research can be extrapolated to the field to understand metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks.
918	4289	This work can also help to explain processes that occur within the Earth, such as subduction and magma chamber evolution.
919	4290	Structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples to observe the fabric within the rocks which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks.
919	4291	They also plot and combine measurements of geological structures in order to better understand the orientations of faults and folds in order to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area.
919	4292	In addition, they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings.
920	4293	Among the most well-known experiments in structural geology are those involving orogenic wedges, which are zones in which mountains are built along convergent tectonic plate boundaries.
920	4294	In the analog versions of these experiments, horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop, which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a critically tapered (all angles remain the same) orogenic wedge.
920	4295	Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models, though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt.
920	4296	This helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of the mountain range.
920	4297	These studies can also give useful information about pathways for metamorphism through pressure, temperature, space, and time.
921	4298	In the laboratory, stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections that can be returned from the field, such as those from drill cores.
921	4299	Stratigraphers also analyze data from geophysical surveys that show the locations of stratigraphic units in the subsurface.
921	4300	Geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce a better view of the subsurface, and stratigraphers often use computer programs to do this in three dimensions.
921	4301	Stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes occurring on the surface of the Earth, interpret past environments, and locate areas for water, coal, and hydrocarbon extraction.
922	4302	In the laboratory, biostratigraphers analyze rock samples from outcrop and drill cores for the fossils found in them.
922	4303	These fossils help scientists to date the core and to understand the depositional environment in which the rock units formed.
922	4304	Geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section in order to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition.
922	4305	Magnetic stratigraphers look for signs of magnetic reversals in igneous rock units within the drill cores.
922	4306	Other scientists perform stable isotope studies on the rocks to gain information about past climate.
923	4307	Some modern scholars, such as Fielding H. Garrison, are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end.
923	4308	Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea.
923	4309	Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981–1037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science.
923	4310	In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.
924	4311	James Hutton is often viewed as the first modern geologist.
924	4312	In 1785 he presented a paper entitled Theory of the Earth to the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
924	4313	In his paper, he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land.
924	4314	Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795 (Vol.
925	4315	The first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure.
925	4316	In 1807, Maclure commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States.
925	4317	Almost every state in the Union was traversed and mapped by him, the Allegheny Mountains being crossed and recrossed some 50 times.
925	4318	The results of his unaided labours were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map, and published in the Society's Transactions, together with the nation's first geological map.
925	4319	This antedates William Smith's geological map of England by six years, although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks.
926	4320	Sir Charles Lyell first published his famous book, Principles of Geology, in 1830.
926	4321	This book, which influenced the thought of Charles Darwin, successfully promoted the doctrine of uniformitarianism.
926	4322	This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the Earth's history and are still occurring today.
926	4323	In contrast, catastrophism is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter.
926	4324	Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism, the idea was not widely accepted at the time.
927	4325	Newcastle upon Tyne (RP: i/ˌnjuːkɑːsəl əˌpɒn ˈtaɪn/; Locally: i/njuːˌkæsəl əˌpən ˈtaɪn/), commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, 8.5 mi (13.7 km) from the North Sea.
927	4326	Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East and Tyneside the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom.
927	4327	Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities.
927	4328	Newcastle was part of the county of Northumberland until 1400, when it became a county itself, a status it retained until becoming part of Tyne and Wear in 1974.
927	4329	[not in citation given] The regional nickname and dialect for people from Newcastle and the surrounding area is Geordie.
928	4330	The city developed around the Roman settlement Pons Aelius and was named after the castle built in 1080 by Robert Curthose, William the Conqueror's eldest son.
928	4331	The city grew as an important centre for the wool trade in the 14th century, and later became a major coal mining area.
928	4332	The port developed in the 16th century and, along with the shipyards lower down the River Tyne, was amongst the world's largest shipbuilding and ship-repairing centres.
928	4333	Newcastle's economy includes corporate headquarters, learning, digital technology, retail, tourism and cultural centres, from which the city contributes £13 billion towards the United Kingdom's GVA.
928	4334	Among its icons are Newcastle Brown Ale; Newcastle United football club; and the Tyne Bridge.
928	4335	It has hosted the world's most popular half marathon, the Great North Run, since it began in 1981.
929	4336	The first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle was Pons Aelius, a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne.
929	4337	It was given the family name of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who founded it in the 2nd century AD.
929	4338	This rare honour suggests that Hadrian may have visited the site and instituted the bridge on his tour of Britain.
929	4339	The population of Pons Aelius at this period was estimated at 2,000.
929	4340	Fragments of Hadrian's Wall are still visible in parts of Newcastle, particularly along the West Road.
929	4341	The course of the "Roman Wall" can be traced eastwards to the Segedunum Roman fort in Wallsend—the "wall's end"—and to the supply fort Arbeia in South Shields.
929	4342	The extent of Hadrian's Wall was 73 miles (117 km), spanning the width of Britain; the Wall incorporated the Vallum, a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds, and was constructed primarily for defence, to prevent unwanted immigration and the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north, not as a fighting line for a major invasion.
930	4343	Throughout the Middle Ages, Newcastle was England's northern fortress.
930	4344	Incorporated first by Henry II, the city had a new charter granted by Elizabeth in 1589.
930	4345	A 25-foot (7.6 m) high stone wall was built around the town in the 13th century, to defend it from invaders during the Border war against Scotland.
930	4346	The Scots king William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle in 1174, and Edward I brought the Stone of Scone and William Wallace south through the town.
930	4347	Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the 14th century, and was created a county corporate with its own sheriff by Henry IV in 1400.
931	4348	From 1530 a royal act restricted all shipments of coal from Tyneside to Newcastle Quayside, giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of Newcastle burgesses known as the Hostmen.
931	4349	This monopoly, which lasted for a considerable time, helped Newcastle prosper and develop into a major town.
931	4350	The phrase taking coals to Newcastle was first recorded contextually in 1538.
931	4351	The phrase itself means a pointless pursuit.
931	4352	In the 18th century American Timothy Dexter, an entrepreneur, widely regarded as an eccentric, defied this idiom.
931	4353	He was persuaded to sail a shipment of coal to Newcastle by merchants plotting to ruin him; however his shipment arrived on the Tyne during a strike that had crippled local production; unexpectedly he made a considerable profit.
932	4354	In the Sandgate area, to the east of the city and beside the river, resided the close-knit community of keelmen and their families.
932	4355	They were so called because they worked on the keels, boats that were used to transfer coal from the river banks to the waiting colliers, for export to London and elsewhere.
932	4356	In the 1630s about 7,000 out of 20,000 inhabitants of Newcastle died of plague, more than one-third of the population.
932	4357	Specifically within the year 1636, it is roughly estimated with evidence held by the Society of Antiquaries that 47% of the then population of Newcastle died from the epidemic; this may also have been the most devastating loss in any British City in this period.
933	4358	During the English Civil War, the North declared for the King.
933	4359	In a bid to gain Newcastle and the Tyne, Cromwell's allies, the Scots, captured the town of Newburn.
933	4360	In 1644 the Scots then captured the reinforced fortification on the Lawe in South Shields following a siege.
933	4361	In 1644 the city was then besieged for many months and was eventually stormed ('with roaring drummes') and sacked by Cromwell's allies.
933	4362	The grateful King bestowed the motto "Fortiter Defendit Triumphans" ("Triumphing by a brave defence") upon the town.
933	4363	Charles I was imprisoned in Newcastle by the Scots in 1646–7.
934	4364	In the 19th century, shipbuilding and heavy engineering were central to the city's prosperity; and the city was a powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution.
934	4365	This revolution resulted in the urbanization of the city.
934	4366	In 1817 the Maling company, at one time the largest pottery company in the world, moved to the city.
934	4367	The Victorian industrial revolution brought industrial structures that included the 2 1⁄2-mile (4.0 km) Victoria Tunnelling, built in 1842, which provided underground wagon ways to the staithes.
934	4368	On 3 February 1879, Mosley Street in the city, was the first public road in the world to be lit up by the incandescent lightbulb.
934	4369	Newcastle was one of the first cities in the world to be lit up by electric lighting.
934	4370	Innovations in Newcastle and surrounding areas included the development of safety lamps, Stephenson's Rocket, Lord Armstrong's artillery, Be-Ro flour, Joseph Swan's electric light bulbs, and Charles Parsons' invention of the steam turbine, which led to the revolution of marine propulsion and the production of cheap electricity.
934	4371	In 1882, Newcastle became the seat of an Anglican diocese, with St. Nicholas' Church becoming its cathedral.
935	4372	In large parts, Newcastle still retains a medieval street layout.
935	4373	Narrow alleys or 'chares', most of which can only be traversed by foot, still exist in abundance, particularly around the riverside.
935	4374	Stairs from the riverside to higher parts of the city centre and the extant Castle Keep, originally recorded in the 14th century, remain intact in places.
935	4375	Close, Sandhill and Quayside contain modern buildings as well as structures dating from the 15th–18th centuries, including Bessie Surtees House, the Cooperage and Lloyds Quayside Bars, Derwentwater House and "House of Tides", a restaurant situated at a Grade I-listed 16th century merchant's house at 28–30 Close.
936	4376	The city has an extensive neoclassical centre referred to as Tyneside Classical largely developed in the 1830s by Richard Grainger and John Dobson, and recently extensively restored.
936	4377	Broadcaster and writer Stuart Maconie described Newcastle as England's best-looking city and the late German-born British scholar of architecture, Nikolaus Pevsner, describes Grey Street as one of the finest streets in England.
936	4378	The street curves down from Grey's Monument towards the valley of the River Tyne and was voted England's finest street in 2005 in a survey of BBC Radio 4 listeners.
936	4379	In the Google Street View awards of 2010, Grey Street came 3rd in the British picturesque category.
936	4380	Osborne Road came 4th in the foodie street category.
936	4381	A portion of Grainger Town was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the Eldon Square Shopping Centre, including all but one side of the original Eldon Square itself.
937	4382	Another green space in Newcastle is the Town Moor, lying immediately north of the city centre.
937	4383	It is larger than London's famous Hyde Park and Hampstead Heath put together and the freemen of the city have the right to graze cattle on it.
937	4384	The right incidentally extends to the pitch of St. James' Park, Newcastle United Football Club's ground, though this is not exercised, although the Freemen do collect rent for the loss of privilege.
937	4385	Honorary freemen include Bob Geldof, King Harald V of Norway, Bobby Robson, Alan Shearer, the late Nelson Mandela and the Royal Shakespeare Company.
937	4386	The Hoppings funfair, said to be the largest travelling funfair in Europe, is held here annually in June.
938	4387	Large-scale regeneration has replaced former shipping premises with imposing new office developments; an innovative tilting bridge, the Gateshead Millennium Bridge was commissioned by Gateshead Council and has integrated the older Newcastle Quayside more closely with major cultural developments in Gateshead, including the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, the venue for the Turner Prize 2011 and the Norman Foster-designed The Sage Gateshead music centre.
938	4388	The Newcastle and Gateshead Quaysides are now a thriving, cosmopolitan area with bars, restaurants and public spaces.
938	4389	As a tourist promotion, Newcastle and Gateshead have linked together under the banner "NewcastleGateshead", to spearhead the regeneration of the North-East.
938	4390	The River Tyne had the temporary Bambuco Bridge in 2008 for ten days; it was not made for walking, road or cycling, but was just a sculpture.
939	4391	The historic heart of Newcastle is the Grainger Town area.
939	4392	Established on classical streets built by Richard Grainger, a builder and developer, between 1835 and 1842, some of Newcastle upon Tyne's finest buildings and streets lie within this area of the city centre including Grainger Market, Theatre Royal, Grey Street, Grainger Street and Clayton Street.
939	4393	These buildings are predominantly four stories high, with vertical dormers, domes, turrets and spikes.
939	4394	Richard Grainger was said to 'have found Newcastle of bricks and timber and left it in stone'.
939	4395	Of Grainger Town's 450 buildings, 244 are listed, of which 29 are grade I and 49 are grade II*.
940	4396	The Grainger Market replaced an earlier market originally built in 1808 called the Butcher Market.
940	4397	The Grainger Market itself, was opened in 1835 and was Newcastle's first indoor market.
940	4398	At the time of its opening in 1835 it was said to be one of the largest and most beautiful markets in Europe.
940	4399	The opening was celebrated with a grand dinner attended by 2000 guests, and the Laing Art Gallery has a painting of this event.
940	4400	With the exception of the timber roof which was destroyed by a fire in 1901 and replaced by latticed-steel arches the Market is largely in its original condition.
940	4401	The Grainger Market architecture, like most in Grainger Town, which are either grade I or II listed, was listed grade I in 1954 by English Heritage.
941	4402	The climate in Newcastle is oceanic (Köppen Cfb) and significantly milder than some other locations in the world at a similar latitude, due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream (via the North Atlantic Drift).
941	4403	Being in the rain shadow of the North Pennines, it is among the driest cities in the UK.
941	4404	Temperature extremes recorded at Newcastle Weather Centre include 32.5 °C (90.5 °F) during August 1990 down to −12.6 °C (9.3 °F) during January 1982.
941	4405	In contrast to other areas influenced by the Gulf Stream, such as inland Scandinavia, Newcastle has milder winters and cooler summers, similar to the remainder of the British Isles.
942	4406	In 2010, Newcastle was positioned ninth in the retail centre expenditure league of the UK.
942	4407	There are several major shopping areas in Newcastle City Centre.
942	4408	The largest of these is the Eldon Square Shopping Centre, one of the largest city centre shopping complexes in the UK.
942	4409	It incorporates a flagship Debenhams store as well as one of the largest John Lewis stores in the UK.
942	4410	John Lewis is still known to many in Newcastle as Bainbridges.
942	4411	Newcastle store Bainbridge's, opened in 1838, is often cited as the world’s first department store.
942	4412	Emerson Bainbridge (1817–1892), a pioneer and the founder of Bainbridges, sold goods via department, a new for merchant custom for that time.
942	4413	The Bainbridge’s official ledgers reported revenue by department, giving birth to the name department store.
942	4414	Eldon Square is currently undergoing a full redevelopment.
942	4415	A new bus station, replacing the old underground bus station, was officially opened in March 2007.
942	4416	The wing of the centre, including the undercover Green Market, near Grainger Street was demolished in 2007 so that the area could be redeveloped.
942	4417	This was completed in February 2010 with the opening of a flagship Debenhams department store as well as other major stores including Apple, Hollister and Guess.
943	4418	Other shopping destinations in Newcastle include Grainger Street and the area around Grey's Monument, the relatively modern Eldon Garden and Monument Mall complexes, the Newgate Centre, Central Arcade and the traditional Grainger Market.
943	4419	Outside the city centre, the largest suburban shopping areas are Gosforth and Byker.
943	4420	The largest Tesco store in the United Kingdom is located in Kingston Park on the edge of Newcastle.
943	4421	Close to Newcastle, the largest indoor shopping centre in Europe, the MetroCentre, is located in Gateshead.
944	4422	The Tyneside flat was the dominant housing form constructed at the time when the industrial centres on Tyneside were growing most rapidly.
944	4423	They can still be found in areas such as South Heaton in Newcastle but once dominated the streetscape on both sides of the Tyne.
944	4424	Tyneside flats were built as terraces, one of each pair of doors led to an upstairs flat while the other led into the ground-floor flat, each of two or three rooms.
944	4425	A new development in the Ouseburn valley has recreated them; Architects Cany Ash and Robert Sakula were attracted by the possibilities of high density without building high and getting rid of common areas.
946	4426	According to the UK Government's returned 2001 census information, the city of Newcastle had a population of 189,863, whereas the metropolitan borough of Newcastle had a population of around 259,000.
946	4427	Newcastle has a population of 282,442 according to the Office for National Statistics.
946	4428	The metropolitan boroughs of North Tyneside (population circa 201,000), South Tyneside (population circa 148,000) and Gateshead (population circa 201,000) are, along with Newcastle, all part of the Tyneside conurbation (population circa 880,000).
946	4429	The metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear, which consists of the four aforementioned boroughs as well as the City of Sunderland (population circa 275,000), had a population of around 1,076,000 and the Tyne and Wear City Region which also includes North Durham, South East Northumberland and the Tyne Valley has a population of 1,650,000.
946	4430	Newcastle is also home to a large student population with Newcastle and Northumbria Universities in the local area.
946	4431	Areas with predominant student populations include Jesmond and Heaton.
947	4432	According to the same statistics, the average age of people living in Newcastle is 37.8 (the national average being 38.6).
947	4433	Many people in the city have Scottish or Irish ancestors.
947	4434	There is a strong presence of Border Reiver surnames, such as Armstrong, Charlton, Elliot, Johnstone, Kerr, Hall, Nixon, Little and Robson.
947	4435	There are also small but significant Chinese, Jewish and Eastern European (Polish, Czech Roma) populations.
947	4436	There are also estimated to be between 500 and 2,000 Bolivians in Newcastle, forming up to 1% of the population—the largest such percentage of any UK city.
948	4437	The dialect of Newcastle is known as Geordie, and contains a large amount of vocabulary and distinctive word pronunciations not used in other parts of the United Kingdom.
948	4438	The Geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the Anglo-Saxon populations who migrated to and conquered much of England after the end of Roman Imperial rule.
948	4439	This language was the forerunner of Modern English; but while the dialects of other English regions have been heavily altered by the influences of other foreign languages—particularly Latin and Norman French—the Geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language.
948	4440	An example of this is the pronunciation of certain words: "dead", "cow", "house" and "strong" are pronounced "deed", "coo", "hoos" and "strang"—which is how they were pronounced in the Anglo-Saxon language.
948	4441	Other Geordie words with Anglo-Saxon origins include: "larn" (from the Anglo-Saxon "laeran", meaning "teach"), "burn" ("stream") and "gan" ("go").
949	4442	"Bairn" and "hyem", meaning "child" and "home", respectively, are examples of Geordie words with origins in Scandinavia; barn and hjem are the corresponding modern Norwegian and Danish words.
949	4443	Some words used in the Geordie dialect are used elsewhere in the Northern United Kingdom.
949	4444	The words "bonny" (meaning "pretty"), "howay" ("come on"), "stot" ("bounce") and "hadaway" ("go away" or "you're kidding"), all appear to be used in Scots; "aye" ("yes") and "nowt" (IPA://naʊt/, rhymes with out,"nothing") are used elsewhere in Northern England.
949	4445	Many words, however, appear to be used exclusively in Newcastle and the surrounding area, such as "Canny" (a versatile word meaning "good", "nice" or "very"), "hacky" ("dirty"), "netty" ("toilet"), "hoy" ("throw", from the Dutch gooien, via West Frisian), "hockle" ("spit").
950	4446	In a report, published in early February 2007 by the Ear Institute at the University College London, and Widex, a Danish hearing aid manufacturer, Newcastle was named as the noisiest city in the whole of the UK, with an average level of 80.4 decibels.
950	4447	The report claimed that these noise levels would have a negative long-term impact on the health of the city's residents.

980	4597	It was founded in 1852 and named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.
980	4598	The V&A is located in the Brompton district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in an area that has become known as "Albertopolis" because of its association with Prince Albert, the Albert Memorial and the major cultural institutions with which he was associated.

981	4608	Overall, it is one of the largest museums in the world.
982	4609	The V&A has its origins in the Great Exhibition of 1851, with which Henry Cole, the museum's first director, was involved in planning; initially it was known as the Museum of Manufactures, first opening in May 1852 at Marlborough House, but by September had been transferred to Somerset House.
982	4610	At this stage the collections covered both applied art and science.
982	4611	Several of the exhibits from the Exhibition were purchased to form the nucleus of the collection.
982	4612	By February 1854 discussions were underway to transfer the museum to the current site and it was renamed South Kensington Museum.
982	4613	In 1855 the German architect Gottfried Semper, at the request of Cole, produced a design for the museum, but it was rejected by the Board of Trade as too expensive.
982	4614	The site was occupied by Brompton Park House; this was extended including the first refreshment rooms opened in 1857, the museum being the first in the world to provide such a facility.
983	4615	The official opening by Queen Victoria was on 22 June 1857.
983	4616	In the following year, late night openings were introduced, made possible by the use of gas lighting.
983	4617	This was to enable in the words of Cole "to ascertain practically what hours are most convenient to the working classes"—this was linked to the use of the collections of both applied art and science as educational resources to help boost productive industry.
983	4618	In these early years the practical use of the collection was very much emphasised as opposed to that of "High Art" at the National Gallery and scholarship at the British Museum.
983	4619	George Wallis (1811–1891), the first Keeper of Fine Art Collection, passionately promoted the idea of wide art education through the museum collections.
983	4620	This led to the transfer to the museum of the School of Design that had been founded in 1837 at Somerset House; after the transfer it was referred to as the Art School or Art Training School, later to become the Royal College of Art which finally achieved full independence in 1949.
983	4621	From the 1860s to the 1880s the scientific collections had been moved from the main museum site to various improvised galleries to the west of Exhibition Road.
983	4622	In 1893 the "Science Museum" had effectively come into existence when a separate director was appointed.
984	4623	Before the return of the collections after the war, the Britain Can Make It exhibition was held between September and November 1946, attracting nearly a million and a half visitors.
984	4624	This was organised by the Council of Industrial Design established by the British government in 1944 "to promote by all practicable means the improvement of design in the products of British industry".
984	4625	The success of this exhibition led to the planning of the Festival of Britain (1951).
984	4626	By 1948 most of the collections had been returned to the museum.
985	4627	In July 1973, as part of its outreach programme to young people, the V&A became the first museum in Britain to present a rock concert.
985	4628	The V&A presented a combined concert/lecture by British progressive folk-rock band Gryphon, who explored the lineage of mediaeval music and instrumentation and related how those contributed to contemporary music 500 years later.
985	4629	This innovative approach to bringing young people to museums was a hallmark of the directorship of Roy Strong and was subsequently emulated by some other British museums.
986	4630	The V&A is in discussion with the University of Dundee, University of Abertay, Dundee City Council and the Scottish Government with a view to opening a new £43 million gallery in Dundee that would use the V&A brand although it would be funded through and operated independently.
986	4631	As of 2015, with costs estimated at £76 million, it is the most expensive gallery project ever undertaken in Scotland.
986	4632	The V&A Dundee will be on the city's waterfront and is intended to focus on fashion, architecture, product design, graphic arts and photography.
986	4633	It is planned that it could open within five years.
986	4634	Dundee City Council is expected to pay a major part of the running costs.
986	4635	The V&A is not contributing financially, but will be providing expertise, loans and exhibitions.
987	4636	The Victorian parts of the building have a complex history, with piecemeal additions by different architects.
987	4637	Founded in May 1852, it was not until 1857 that the museum moved to the present site.
987	4638	This area of London was known as Brompton but had been renamed South Kensington.
987	4639	The land was occupied by Brompton Park House, which was extended, most notably by the "Brompton Boilers", which were starkly utilitarian iron galleries with a temporary look and were later dismantled and used to build the V&A Museum of Childhood.
987	4640	The first building to be erected that still forms part of the museum was the Sheepshanks Gallery in 1857 on the eastern side of the garden.
987	4641	Its architect was civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke, Royal Engineers, who was appointed by Cole.
987	4642	The next major expansions were designed by the same architect, the Turner and Vernon galleries built 1858-9 to house the eponymous collections (later transferred to the Tate Gallery) and now used as the picture galleries and tapestry gallery respectively.
987	4643	The North and South Courts, were then built, both of which opened by June 1862.
987	4644	They now form the galleries for temporary exhibitions and are directly behind the Sheepshanks Gallery.
987	4645	On the very northern edge of the site is situated the Secretariat Wing, also built in 1862 this houses the offices and board room etc.
987	4646	and is not open to the public.
988	4647	An ambitious scheme of decoration was developed for these new areas: a series of mosaic figures depicting famous European artists of the Medieval and Renaissance period.
988	4648	These have now been removed to other areas of the museum.
988	4649	Also started were a series of frescoes by Lord Leighton: Industrial Arts as Applied to War 1878–1880 and Industrial Arts Applied to Peace, which was started but never finished.
988	4650	To the east of this were additional galleries, the decoration of which was the work of another designer Owen Jones, these were the Oriental Courts (covering India, China and Japan) completed in 1863, none of this decoration survives, part of these galleries became the new galleries covering the 19th century, opened in December 2006.
988	4651	The last work by Fowke was the design for the range of buildings on the north and west sides of the garden, this includes the refreshment rooms, reinstated as the Museum Café in 2006, with the silver gallery above, (at the time the ceramics gallery), the top floor has a splendid lecture theatre although this is seldom open to the general public.
988	4652	The ceramic staircase in the northwest corner of this range of buildings was designed by F. W. Moody and has architectural details of moulded and coloured pottery.
988	4653	All the work on the north range was designed and built in 1864–69.
988	4654	This building replaced Brompton Park House, which could then be demolished to make way for the south range.
989	4655	The interiors of the three refreshment rooms were assigned to different designers.
989	4656	The Green Dining Room 1866–68 was the work of Philip Webb and William Morris, and displays Elizabethan influences.
989	4657	The lower part of the walls are panelled in wood with a band of paintings depicting fruit and the occasional figure, with moulded plaster foliage on the main part of the wall and a plaster frieze around the decorated ceiling and stained-glass windows by Edward Burne-Jones.
989	4658	The Centre Refreshment Room 1865–77 was designed in a Renaissance style by James Gamble, the walls and even the Ionic columns are covered in decorative and moulded ceramic tile, the ceiling consists of elaborate designs on enamelled metal sheets and matching stained-glass windows, the marble fireplace was designed and sculpted by Alfred Stevens and was removed from Dorchester House prior to that building's demolition in 1929.
989	4659	The Grill Room 1876–81 was designed by Sir Edward Poynter, the lower part of the walls consist of blue and white tiles with various figures and foliage enclosed by wood panelling, above there are large tiled scenes with figures depicting the four seasons and the twelve months these were painted by ladies from the Art School then based in the museum, the windows are also stained glass, there is an elaborate cast-iron grill still in place.
990	4660	With the death of Captain Francis Fowke, Royal Engineers the next architect to work at the museum was Colonel (later Major General) Henry Young Darracott Scott, also of the Royal Engineers.
990	4661	He designed to the north west of the garden the five-storey School for Naval Architects (also known as the science schools), now the Henry Cole Wing in 1867–72.
990	4662	Wild designed the impressive staircase that rises the full height of the building, made from Cadeby stone the steps are 7 feet (2.1 m) in length, the balustrades and columns are Portland stone.
990	4663	It is now used to jointly house the prints and architectural drawings of the V&A (prints, drawings, paintings and photographs) and Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA Drawings and Archives Collections); and the Sackler Centre for arts education, which opened in 2008.
991	4664	Continuing the style of the earlier buildings, various designers were responsible for the decoration, the terracotta embellishments were again the work of Godfrey Sykes, although sgraffito was used to decorate the east side of the building designed by F. W. Moody, a final embellishment were the wrought iron gates made as late as 1885 designed by Starkie Gardner, these lead to a passage through the building.
991	4665	Scott also designed the two Cast Courts 1870–73 to the southeast of the garden (the site of the "Brompton Boilers"), these vast spaces have ceilings 70 feet (21 m) in height to accommodate the plaster casts of parts of famous buildings, including Trajan's Column (in two separate pieces).
991	4666	The final part of the museum designed by Scott was the Art Library and what is now the sculpture gallery on the south side of the garden, built 1877–83, the exterior mosaic panels in the parapet were designed by Reuben Townroe who also designed the plaster work in the library, Sir John Taylor designed the book shelves and cases, also this was the first part of the museum to have electric lighting.
991	4667	This completed the northern half of the site, creating a quadrangle with the garden at its centre, but left the museum without a proper façade.
991	4668	In 1890 the government launched a competition to design new buildings for the museum, with architect Alfred Waterhouse as one of the judges; this would give the museum a new imposing front entrance.
992	4669	The main façade, built from red brick and Portland stone, stretches 720 feet (220 m) along Cromwell Gardens and was designed by Aston Webb after winning a competition in 1891 to extend the museum.
992	4670	Construction took place between 1899 and 1909.
992	4671	Stylistically it is a strange hybrid, although much of the detail belongs to the Renaissance there are medieval influences at work.
992	4672	The main entrance consisting of a series of shallow arches supported by slender columns and niches with twin doors separated by pier is Romanesque in form but Classical in detail.
992	4673	Likewise the tower above the main entrance has an open work crown surmounted by a statue of fame, a feature of late Gothic architecture and a feature common in Scotland, but the detail is Classical.
992	4674	The main windows to the galleries are also mullioned and transomed, again a Gothic feature, the top row of windows are interspersed with statues of many of the British artists whose work is displayed in the museum.
993	4675	Prince Albert appears within the main arch above the twin entrances, Queen Victoria above the frame around the arches and entrance, sculpted by Alfred Drury.
993	4676	These façades surround four levels of galleries.
993	4677	Other areas designed by Webb include the Entrance Hall and Rotunda, the East and West Halls, the areas occupied by the shop and Asian Galleries as well as the Costume Gallery.
993	4678	The interior makes much use of marble in the entrance hall and flanking staircases, although the galleries as originally designed were white with restrained classical detail and mouldings, very much in contrast to the elaborate decoration of the Victorian galleries, although much of this decoration was removed in the early 20th century.
994	4679	In the immediate post-war years there was little money available for other than essential repairs.
994	4680	The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967.
994	4681	This involved flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006).
994	4682	Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600–1800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical).
994	4683	In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science.
994	4684	In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling.
994	4685	To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982.
994	4686	This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art.
994	4687	These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the façade.
995	4688	A few galleries were redesigned in the 1990s including the Indian, Japanese, Chinese, iron work, the main glass galleries and the main silverware gallery which was further enhanced in 2002 when some of the Victorian decoration was recreated.
995	4689	This included two of the ten columns having their ceramic decoration replaced and the elaborate painted designs restored on the ceiling.
995	4690	As part of the 2006 renovation the mosaic floors in the sculpture gallery were restored—most of the Victorian floors were covered in linoleum after the Second World War.
995	4691	After the success of the British Galleries, opened in 2001, it was decided to embark on a major redesign of all the galleries in the museum; this is known as "FuturePlan", and was created in consultation with the exhibition designers and masterplanners Metaphor.
995	4692	The plan is expected to take about ten years and was started in 2002.
995	4693	To date several galleries have been redesigned, notably, in 2002: the main Silver Gallery, Contemporary; in 2003: Photography, the main entrance, The Painting Galleries; in 2004: the tunnel to the subway leading to South Kensington tube station, New signage throughout the museum, architecture, V&A and RIBA reading rooms and stores, metalware, Members' Room, contemporary glass, the Gilbert Bayes sculpture gallery; in 2005: portrait miniatures, prints and drawings, displays in Room 117, the garden, sacred silver and stained glass; in 2006: Central Hall Shop, Islamic Middle East, the new café, sculpture galleries.
995	4694	Several designers and architects have been involved in this work.
995	4695	Eva Jiřičná designed the enhancements to the main entrance and rotunda, the new shop, the tunnel and the sculpture galleries.
995	4696	Gareth Hoskins was responsible for contemporary and architecture, Softroom, Islamic Middle East and the Members' Room, McInnes Usher McKnight Architects (MUMA) were responsible for the new Cafe and designed the new Medieval and Renaissance galleries which opened in 2009.
996	4697	The central garden was redesigned by Kim Wilkie and opened as the John Madejski Garden, on 5 July 2005.
996	4698	The design is a subtle blend of the traditional and modern, the layout is formal; there is an elliptical water feature lined in stone with steps around the edge which may be drained to use the area for receptions, gatherings or exhibition purposes.
996	4699	This is in front of the bronze doors leading to the refreshment rooms, a central path flanked by lawns leads to the sculpture gallery; the north, east and west sides have herbaceous borders along the museum walls with paths in front which continues along the south façade; in the two corners by the north façade there is planted an American Sweetgum tree; the southern, eastern and western edges of the lawns have glass planters which contain orange and lemon trees in summer, these are replaced by bay trees in winter.
997	4700	In 2004, the V&A alongside Royal Institute of British Architects opened the first permanent gallery in the UK covering the history of architecture with displays using models, photographs, elements from buildings and original drawings.
997	4701	With the opening of the new gallery, the RIBA Drawings and Archives Collection has been transferred to the museum, joining the already extensive collection held by the V&A.
997	4702	With over 600,000 drawings, over 750,000 papers and paraphernalia, and over 700,000 photographs from around the world, together they form the world's most comprehensive architectural resource.
998	4703	Not only are all the major British architects of the last four hundred years represented, but many European (especially Italian) and American architects' drawings are held in the collection.
998	4704	The RIBA's holdings of over 330 drawings by Andrea Palladio are the largest in the world, other Europeans well represented are Jacques Gentilhatre and Antonio Visentini.

1007	4757	The National Art Library (also called Word and Image Department) at the Victoria and Albert Museum collection catalog used to be kept in different formats including printed exhibit catalogs, and card catalogs.
1007	4758	A computer system called MODES cataloging system was used from the 1980s to the 1990s, but those electronic files were not available to the library users.
1007	4759	All of the archival material at the National Art Library is using Encoded Archival Description (EAD).
1007	4760	The Victoria and Albert Museum has a computer system but most of the items in the collection, unless those were newly accessioned into the collection, probably do not show up in the computer system.
1007	4761	There is a feature on the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site called "Search the Collections," but not everything is listed there.
1008	4762	The Victoria and Albert Museum’s Word and Image Department was under the same pressure being felt in archives around the world, to digitize their collection.
1008	4763	A large scale digitization project began in 2007 in that department.
1008	4764	That project was entitled the Factory Project to reference Andy Warhol and to create a factory to completely digitize the collection.
1008	4765	The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs utilizing digital cameras.
1008	4766	The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot.
1008	4767	Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site.
1008	4768	15,000 images were taken during the first year of the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts.
1008	4769	The second step of the Factory Project is to catalog everything.
1008	4770	The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection.
1008	4771	All of those items which were photographed and cataloged, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project.
1008	4772	The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department.
1008	4773	There is a "Search the Collections" feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site.
1008	4774	The main impetus behind the large-scale digitization project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.
1009	4775	Not only the work of British artists and craftspeople is on display, but also work produced by European artists that was purchased or commissioned by British patrons, as well as imports from Asia, including porcelain, cloth and wallpaper.
1009	4776	Designers and artists whose work is on display in the galleries include Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Grinling Gibbons, Daniel Marot, Louis Laguerre, Antonio Verrio, Sir James Thornhill, William Kent, Robert Adam, Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton, Canova, Thomas Chippendale, Pugin, William Morris.
1009	4777	Patrons who have influenced taste are also represented by works of art from their collections, these include: Horace Walpole (a major influence on the Gothic Revival), William Thomas Beckford and Thomas Hope.
1010	4778	The galleries also link design to wider trends in British culture.
1010	4779	For instance, design in the Tudor period was influenced by the spread of printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain.
1010	4780	In the Stuart period, increasing trade, especially with Asia, enabled wider access to luxuries like carpets, lacquered furniture, silks and porcelain.
1010	4781	In the Georgian age there was increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure.
1010	4782	For example, the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies.
1010	4783	European styles seen on the Grand Tour also influenced taste.
1010	4784	As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the growth of mass production produced entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade.
1010	4785	In the Victorian era new technology and machinery had a significant effect on manufacturing, and for the first time since the reformation, the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches had a major effect on art and design such as the Gothic Revival.
1010	4786	There is a large display on the Great Exhibition which, among other things, led to the founding of the V&A.
1010	4787	In the later 19th century, the increasing backlash against industrialization, led by John Ruskin, contributed to the Arts and Crafts movement.
1011	4788	One of the most dramatic parts of the museum is the Cast Courts in the sculpture wing, comprising two large, skylighted rooms two storeys high housing hundreds of plaster casts of sculptures, friezes and tombs.
1011	4789	One of these is dominated by a full-scale replica of Trajan's Column, cut in half in order to fit under the ceiling.

1012	4792	Well represented in the collection is Meissen porcelain, from the first factory in Europe to discover the Chinese method of making porcelain.
1012	4793	Among the finest examples are the Meissen Vulture from 1731 and the Möllendorff Dinner Service, designed in 1762 by Frederick II the Great.
1012	4794	Ceramics from the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres are extensive, especially from the 18th and 19th centuries.

1012	4796	Examples from every factory are represented, the collections of Chelsea porcelain and Worcester Porcelain being especially fine.
1012	4797	All the major 19th-century British factories are also represented.
1012	4798	A major boost to the collections was the Salting Bequest made in 1909, which enriched the museum's stock of Chinese and Japanese ceramics.
1012	4799	This bequest forms part of the finest collection of East Asian pottery and porcelain in the world, including Kakiemon ware.
1013	4800	Many famous potters, such as Josiah Wedgwood, William De Morgan and Bernard Leach as well as Mintons & Royal Doulton are represented in the collection.
1013	4801	There is an extensive collection of Delftware produced in both Britain and Holland, which includes a circa 1695 flower pyramid over a metre in height.
1013	4802	Bernard Palissy has several examples of his work in the collection including dishes, jugs and candlesticks.

1014	4806	The glass collection covers 4000 years of glass making, and has over 6000 items from Africa, Britain, Europe, America and Asia.
1014	4807	The earliest glassware on display comes from Ancient Egypt and continues through the Ancient Roman, Medieval, Renaissance covering areas such as Venetian glass and Bohemian glass and more recent periods, including Art Nouveau glass by Louis Comfort Tiffany and Émile Gallé, the Art Deco style is represented by several examples by René Lalique.
1014	4808	There are many examples of crystal chandeliers both English, displayed in the British galleries and foreign for example Venetian (attributed to Giuseppe Briati) dated c1750 are in the collection.

1033	4895	With the opening of the Dorothy and Michael Hintze sculpture galleries in 2006 it was decided to extend the chronology of the works on display up to 1950; this has involved loans by other museums, including Tate Britain, so works by Henry Moore and Jacob Epstein along with other of their contemporaries are now on view.
1033	4896	These galleries concentrate on works dated 1600 to 1950 by British sculptors, works by continental sculptors who worked in Britain, and works bought by British patrons from the continental sculptors, such as Canova's Theseus and the Minotaur.
1033	4897	The galleries overlooking the garden are arranged by theme, tomb sculpture, portraiture, garden sculpture and mythology.

1038	4918	The conservators specialise in particular areas of conservation.
1038	4919	Areas covered by conservator's work include "preventive" conservation this includes: performing surveys, assessments and providing advice on the handling of items, correct packaging, mounting and handling procedures during movement and display to reduce risk of damaging objects.
1038	4920	Activities include controlling the museum environment (for example, temperature and light) and preventing pests (primarily insects) from damaging artefacts.
1038	4921	The other major category is "interventive" conservation, this includes: cleaning and reintegration to strengthen fragile objects, reveal original surface decoration, and restore shape.
1038	4922	Interventive treatment makes an object more stable, but also more attractive and comprehensible to the viewer.
1038	4923	It is usually undertaken on items that are to go on public display.
1039	4924	The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) (stylized in its logo as abc since 1957) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is owned by the Disney–ABC Television Group, a subsidiary of Disney Media Networks division of The Walt Disney Company.
1039	4925	The network is part of the Big Three television networks.
1039	4926	The network is headquartered on Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street in Manhattan, with additional major offices and production facilities in New York City, Los Angeles and Burbank, California.
1040	4927	ABC originally launched on October 12, 1943 as a radio network, separated from and serving as the successor to the NBC Blue Network, which had been purchased by Edward J. Noble.
1040	4928	It extended its operations to television in 1948, following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks CBS and NBC.
1040	4929	In the mid-1950s, ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres, a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures.
1040	4930	Leonard Goldenson, who had been the head of UPT, made the new television network profitable by helping develop and greenlight many successful series.
1040	4931	In the 1980s, after purchasing an 80% interest in cable sports channel ESPN, the network's parent merged with Capital Cities Communications, owner of several print publications, and television and radio stations.
1040	4932	In 1996, most of Capital Cities/ABC's assets were purchased by The Walt Disney Company.
1041	4933	The television network has eight owned-and-operated and over 232 affiliated television stations throughout the United States and its territories.
1041	4934	Most Canadians have access to at least one U.S.-based ABC affiliate, either over-the-air (in areas located within proximity to the Canada–United States border) or through a cable, satellite or IPTV provider, although most ABC programs are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that allow pay television providers to replace an American station's signal with the feed of a Canadian broadcaster to protect domestic programming rights and advertising revenue.
1041	4935	ABC News provides news and features content for select radio stations owned by Citadel Broadcasting, which purchased the ABC Radio properties in 2007.
1042	4936	In the 1930s, radio in the United States was dominated by three companies: the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the Mutual Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company (NBC).
1042	4937	The last was owned by electronics manufacturer Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which owned two radio networks that each ran different varieties of programming, NBC Blue and NBC Red.
1042	4938	The NBC Blue Network was created in 1927 for the primary purpose of testing new programs on markets of lesser importance than those served by NBC Red, which served the major cities, and to test drama series.
1043	4939	In 1934, Mutual filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding its difficulties in establishing new stations, in a radio market that was already being saturated by NBC and CBS.
1043	4940	In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the practices of radio networks and published its report on the broadcasting of network radio programs in 1940.
1043	4941	The report recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue.
1043	4942	At that time, the NBC Red Network was the principal radio network in the United States and, according to the FCC, RCA was using NBC Blue to eliminate any hint of competition.
1043	4943	Having no power over the networks themselves, the FCC established a regulation forbidding licenses to be issued for radio stations if they were affiliated with a network which already owned multiple networks that provided content of public interest.
1044	4944	Once Mutual's appeals against the FCC were rejected, RCA decided to sell NBC Blue in 1941, and gave the mandate to do so to Mark Woods.
1044	4945	RCA converted the NBC Blue Network into an independent subsidiary, formally divorcing the operations of NBC Red and NBC Blue on January 8, 1942, with the Blue Network being referred to on-air as either "Blue" or "Blue Network".
1044	4946	The newly separated NBC Red and NBC Blue divided their respective corporate assets.
1044	4947	Between 1942 and 1943, Woods offered to sell the entire NBC Blue Network, a package that included leases on landlines, three pending television licenses (WJZ-TV in New York City, KGO-TV in San Francisco and WENR-TV in Chicago), 60 affiliates, four operations facilities (in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington D.C.), contracts with actors, and the brand associated with the Blue Network.
1044	4948	Investment firm Dillon, Read & Co. (which was later acquired by the Swiss Bank Corporation in 1997) offered $7.5 million to purchase the network, but the offer was rejected by Woods and RCA president David Sarnoff.
1045	4949	Edward John Noble, the owner of Life Savers candy, drugstore chain Rexall and New York City radio station WMCA, purchased the network for $8 million.
1045	4950	Due to FCC ownership rules, the transaction, which was to include the purchase of three RCA stations by Noble, would require him to resell his station with the FCC's approval.
1045	4951	The Commission authorized the transaction on October 12, 1943.
1045	4952	Soon afterward, the Blue Network was purchased by the new company Noble founded, the American Broadcasting System.
1045	4953	Noble subsequently acquired the rights to the "American Broadcasting Company" name from George B. Storer in 1944; its parent company adopted the corporate name American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. Woods retained his position as president and CEO of ABC until December 1949, and was subsequently promoted to vice-chairman of the board before leaving ABC altogether on June 30, 1951.
1046	4954	ABC became an aggressive competitor to NBC and CBS when, continuing NBC Blue's traditions of public service, it aired symphony performances conducted by Paul Whiteman, performances from the Metropolitan Opera, and jazz concerts aired as part of its broadcast of The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street announced by Milton Cross.
1046	4955	The network also became known for such suspenseful dramas as Sherlock Holmes, Gang Busters and Counterspy, as well as several mid-afternoon youth-oriented programs.
1046	4956	However, ABC made a name for itself by utilizing the practice of counterprogramming, with which it often placed shows of its own against the offerings of NBC and CBS, adopting the use of the Magnetophon tape recorder, brought to the U.S. from Nazi Germany after its conquest, to pre-record its programming.
1046	4957	With the help of the Magnetophon, ABC was able to provide its stars with greater freedom in terms of time, and also attract several big names, such as Bing Crosby at a time when NBC and CBS did not allow pre-taped shows.
1047	4958	A second period of international expansion is linked to that of the ESPN network in the 1990s, and policies enacted in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks (which included the expansion of several of the company's U.S.-based cable networks including Disney Channel and its spinoffs Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney and Jetix; although Disney also sold its 33% stake in European sports channel Eurosport for $155 million in June 2000).
1047	4959	In contrast to Disney's other channels, ABC is broadcast in the United States, although the network's programming is syndicated in many countries.
1047	4960	The policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived in 2004 when on September 27 of that year, ABC announced the launch of ABC1, a free-to-air channel in the United Kingdom owned by the ABC Group.
1047	4961	However, on September 8, 2007, Disney announced that it would discontinue ABC1 citing to the channel's inability to attain sustainable viewership.
1047	4962	With ABC1's shutdown that October, the company's attempt to develop ABC International were discontinued.
1048	4963	The idea was to create a network of wholly and partially owned channels, and affiliates to rebroadcast the network's programs.
1048	4964	In 1959, this rerun activity was completed with program syndication, with ABC Films selling programs to networks not owned by ABC.
1048	4965	The arrival of satellite television ended the need for ABC to hold interests in other countries; many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties.
1048	4966	As a result, ABC was forced to sell all of its interests in international networks, mainly in Japan and Latin America, in the 1970s.
1049	4967	The first attempts to internationalize the ABC television network date back to the 1950s, after Leonard Goldenson, following the United Paramount Theatres model, tried to use on ABC the same strategies he had made in expanding UPT's theater operation to the international market.
1049	4968	Leonard Goldenson said that ABC's first international activity was broadcasting the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953; CBS and NBC were unable to cover the coronation live due to respective issues with technical problems and flight delays.
1049	4969	NBC's plane landed in Latin America[where?
1049	4970	], leading ABC to learn of subsidiaries in that region.
1049	4971	Goldenson tried international investing, having ABC invest in the Latin American market, acquiring a 51% interest in a network covering Central America.
1049	4972	Goldenson also cited interest in Japan in the early 1950s, acquiring a 5% stake in two new domestic networks, the Mainichi Broadcasting System in 1951 and Nihon Educational Television in 1957.
1049	4973	Goldenson also invested in broadcasting properties in Beirut in the mid-1960s.
1050	4974	ABC currently holds the broadcast rights to the Academy Awards, Emmy Awards (which are rotated across all four major networks on a year-to-year basis), American Music Awards, Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade, Tournament of Roses Parade, Country Music Association Awards and the CMA Music Festival.
1050	4975	Since 2000, ABC has also owned the television rights to most of the Peanuts television specials, having acquired the broadcast rights from CBS, which originated the specials in 1965 with the debut of A Charlie Brown Christmas (other Peanuts specials broadcast annually by ABC, including A Charlie Brown Christmas, include It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving).
1051	4976	Since 1974, ABC has generally aired Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on New Year's Eve (hosted first by its creator Dick Clark, and later by his successor Ryan Seacrest); the only exception was in 1999, when ABC put it on a one-year hiatus to provide coverage of the international millennium festivities, though Clark's traditional countdown from Times Square was still featured within the coverage.
1051	4977	ABC has also aired the Miss America pageant from 1954 to 1956, 1997 to 2005 (with the television rights being assumed by cable channel TLC in 2006, when the pageant moved from its longtime homebase in Atlantic City to Las Vegas, before returning to Atlantic City in 2013) and since 2011.
1051	4978	Under its current contract with the Miss America Organization, ABC will continue to broadcast the pageant through 2016.
1052	4979	ABC's daytime schedule currently features talk shows The View and The Chew, and the soap opera General Hospital, the latter of which is the longest-running entertainment program in the history of the ABC television network, having aired since 1963.
1052	4980	ABC also broadcasts the morning news program Good Morning America and has done so since 1975, though that program is not considered to be part of the ABC Daytime block.
1052	4981	In addition to the long-running All My Children (1970–2011) and One Life to Live (1968–2012), notable past soap operas seen on the daytime lineup include Ryan's Hope, Dark Shadows, Loving, The City and Port Charles.
1052	4982	ABC also aired the last nine years of the Procter & Gamble-produced soap The Edge of Night, following its cancellation by CBS in 1975.
1052	4983	ABC Daytime has also aired a number of game shows, including The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game, Let's Make a Deal, Password, Split Second, The $10,000/$20,000 Pyramid, Family Feud, The Better Sex, Trivia Trap, All-Star Blitz and Hot Streak.
1053	4984	Sports programming is also provided on some weekend afternoons at any time from 12:00 to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Pacific) and, during college football season, during prime time on Saturday nights as part of the Saturday Night Football package.
1053	4985	During the summer, ABC airs ESPN-produced highlight compilation programs for The Open Championship golf and The Wimbledon tennis tournaments to provide some presence for both events on American broadcast television.
1053	4986	ABC also carries various X Games weekend events not broadcast by ESPN.
1053	4987	ABC airs NBA games on Sundays, normally starting in January as "NBA Sunday Showcase" during the regular season, and shows Christmas Day games, regularly between 2–7 PM ET, and NBA playoff games during the weekends, and exclusive rights to the NBA Finals.
1054	4988	While its radio network was undergoing reconstruction, ABC found it difficult to avoid falling behind on the new medium of television.
1054	4989	To ensure a space, in 1947, ABC submitted five applications for television station licenses, one for each market where it owned and operated a radio station (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Detroit).
1054	4990	These applications all requested for the stations to broadcast on VHF channel 7, as Frank Marx, then ABC's vice-president of engineering, thought that the low-band VHF frequencies (corresponding to channels 2 through 6) would be requisitioned from broadcasting use and reallocated for the U.S. Army.
1055	4991	In the fall of 1949, ABC found itself in the position of an outsider, with less coverage than two of its competing networks, CBS and NBC, even though it was on par with them in some major cities and had a headstart over its third rival at the time, the DuMont Television Network.
1055	4992	Before the freeze ended in 1952, there were only 108 existing television stations in the United States; a few major cities (such as Boston) had only two television stations, many other cities (such as Pittsburgh and St. Louis) had only one, and still many others (such as Denver and Portland) did not yet have any television service.
1055	4993	The result was a strange period where television flourished in certain areas and network radio remained the main source of broadcast entertainment and news in others.
1056	4994	At the end of 1949, movie theater operator United Paramount Theatres (UPT) was forced by the U.S. Supreme Court to become an independent entity, separating itself from Paramount Pictures.
1056	4995	For its part, ABC was on the verge of bankruptcy, with only five owned-and-operated stations and nine full-time affiliates.
1056	4996	Its revenues, which were related to advertising and were indexed compared to the number of listeners/viewers, failed to compensate for its heavy investments in purchasing and building stations.
1056	4997	In 1951, a rumor even mentioned that the network would be sold to CBS.
1056	4998	In 1951, Noble held a 58% ownership stake in ABC, giving him $5 million with which to prevent ABC from going bankrupt; as banks refused further credit, that amount was obtained through a loan from the Prudential Insurance Company of America.
1057	4999	Leonard Goldenson, the president of UPT (which sought to diversify itself at the time), approached Noble in 1951 on a proposal for UPT to purchase ABC.
1057	5000	Noble received other offers, including one from CBS founder William S. Paley; however, a merger with CBS would have forced that network to sell its New York City and Los Angeles stations at the very least.
1057	5001	Goldenson and Noble reached a tentative agreement in the late spring of 1951 in which UPT would acquire ABC and turn it into a subsidiary of the company that would retain autonomy in its management.
1057	5002	On June 6, 1951, the tentative agreement was approved by UPT's board of directors.
1057	5003	However, the transaction had to be approved by the FCC because of the presence of television networks and the recent separation between Paramount and UPT.
1057	5004	Insofar as Paramount Pictures was already a shareholder in the DuMont Television Network, the FCC conducted a series of hearings to ensure whether Paramount was truly separated from United Paramount Theatres, and whether it was violating antitrust laws.
1058	5005	In 1952, when the release of the FCC's Sixth Report and Order announced the end of its freeze on new station license applications, among the issues the Commission was slated to address was whether to approve the UPT-ABC merger.
1058	5006	One FCC Commissioner saw the possibility of ABC, funded by UPT, becoming a viable and competitive third television network.
1058	5007	On February 9, 1953, the FCC approved UPT's purchase of ABC in exchange for $25 million in shares.
1058	5008	The merged company, renamed American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. and headquartered in the Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway in Manhattan, owned six AM and several FM radio stations, five television stations and 644 cinemas in 300 U.S. cities.
1058	5009	To comply with FCC ownership restrictions in effect at the time that barred common ownership of two television stations in the same market, UPT sold its Chicago television station, WBKB-TV, to CBS (which subsequently changed the station's call letters to WBBM-TV) for $6 million, while it kept ABC's existing Chicago station, WENR-TV.
1058	5010	The merged company acquired the WBKB call letters for channel 7, which would eventually become WLS-TV.
1058	5011	Goldenson began to sell some of the older theaters to help finance the new television network.
1059	5012	The network's flagship owned-and-operated station, WJZ-TV in New York City (later re-called WABC-TV), signed on the air on August 10, 1948, with its first broadcast running for two hours that evening.
1059	5013	ABC's other owned-and-operated stations launched over the course of the next 13 months: WENR-TV in Chicago signed on the air on September 17, while WXYZ-TV in Detroit went on the air on October 9, 1948.
1059	5014	In October 1948, as a result of an influx of television station license applications that it had issued as well as a study it undertook on the use of the VHF spectrum for broadcasting purposes, the FCC implemented a freeze on new station applications.
1059	5015	However, KGO-TV in San Francisco, which had received its license prior to the freeze, made its debut on May 5, 1949.
1059	5016	On May 7, 1949, Billboard revealed that ABC had proposed an investment of $6.25 million, of which it would spend $2.5 million to convert 20 acres (80,937 m2) of land in Hollywood into what would become The Prospect Studios, and construct a transmitter on Mount Wilson, in anticipation of the launch of KECA-TV, which was scheduled to begin operations on August 1 (but would not actually sign on until September 16).
1060	5017	The 1960s would be marked by the rise of family-oriented series in an attempt by ABC to counterprogram its established competitors, but the decade was also marked by the network's gradual transition to color.
1060	5018	On September 30, 1960, ABC premiered The Flintstones, another example of counterprogramming; although the animated series from William Hanna and Joseph Barbera was filmed in color from the beginning, it was initially broadcast in black-and-white, as ABC had not made the necessary technical upgrades to broadcast its programming in color at the time.
1060	5019	The Flintstones allowed ABC to present a novelty, that of prime-time animated programming, but it also allowed the network to begin filling the hole opened by the conclusion of the Disney partnership by carrying family-oriented programming from other producers.
1061	5020	In 1959, Walt Disney Productions, having improved its financial situation, had purchased ABC's shares in the Disneyland theme park for $7.5 million and initiated discussions to renew ABC's television contract for Walt Disney Presents, which was due to expire in 1961.
1061	5021	Walt Disney was approached by NBC to produce color broadcasts of his anthology series (which would be renamed Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color).
1061	5022	Goldenson said ABC could not counter the offer, because the network did not have the technical and financial resources to carry the program in the format.
1061	5023	As a result, ABC and Disney's first television collaboration ended in 1961 (the network would resume its relationship with Disney in 1985, when the anthology series returned to the network for a three-season run as the Disney Sunday Movie until it lost the rights to NBC again in 1988; the Disney anthology series would return to ABC in 1996, following the company's purchase of the future Capital Cities/ABC, as The Wonderful World of Disney).
1062	5024	In 2000, ABC launched a web-based promotional campaign focused around its circle logo, also called "the dot", in which comic book character Little Dot prompted visitors to "download the dot", a program which would cause the ABC logo to fly around the screen and settle in the bottom-right corner.
1062	5025	The network hired the Troika Design Group to design and produce its 2001–02 identity, which continued using the black-and-yellow coloring of the logo and featured dots and stripes in various promotional and identification spots.
1063	5026	In 1998, the network began using a minimalist graphical identity, designed by Pittard Sullivan, featuring a small black-and-white "ABC Circle" logo on a yellow background (promotions during this time also featured a sequence of still photos of the stars of its programs during the timeslot card as well as the schedule sequence that began each night's prime time lineup).
1063	5027	A new four-note theme tune was introduced alongside the package, based around the network's "We Love TV" image campaign introduced that year, creating an audio signature on par with the NBC chimes, CBS' various three-note soundmarks (including the current version used since 2000) and the Fox Fanfare.
1063	5028	The four-note signature has been updated with every television season thereafter (though variants of it used since the 1998–99 season remain in use during the production company vanity cards shown following the closing credits of most programs).
1063	5029	In the fall of 2015, ABC is stopped with its 1998–2002 four-note jingles for promotions and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs over seventeen years, now it have a different and adventure-type music (with the drums of the network's four-note signature in the ending).
1063	5030	The old four-note theme tune is still used by ABC on Demand to the beginning of the ABC show.
1064	5031	In 1983, for the 40th anniversary of the network's founding, ID sequences had the logo appear in a gold CGI design on a blue background, accompanied by the slogan "That Special Feeling" in a script font.
1064	5032	Ten years later, in 1993, the "ABC Circle" logo reverted to its classic white-on-black color scheme, but with gloss effects on both the circle and the letters, and a bronze border surrounding the circle.
1064	5033	The ABC logo first appeared as a on-screen bug in the 1993–94 season, appearing initially only for 60 seconds at the beginning of an act or segment, before appearing throughout programs (except during commercial breaks) beginning in the 1995–96 season; the respective iterations of the translucent logo bug were also incorporated within program promotions until the 2011–12 season.
1065	5034	The 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of many graphical imaging packages for the network in which based the logo's setting mainly on special lighting effects then under development including white, blue, pink, rainbow neon and glittering dotted lines.
1065	5035	Among the "ABC Circle" logo's many variants was a 1977 ID sequence that featured a bubble on a black background representing the circle with glossy gold letters, and as such, was the first ABC identification card to have a three-dimensional appearance.
1066	5036	In 1962, graphic designer Paul Rand redesigned the ABC logo into its best-known (and current) form, with the lowercase letters "abc" enclosed in a single black circle.
1066	5037	The new logo debuted on-air for ABC's promos at the start of the 1963–64 season.
1066	5038	The letters are strongly reminiscent of the Bauhaus typeface designed by Herbert Bayer in the 1920s, but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as ITC Avant Garde and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet.
1066	5039	The logo's simplicity made it easier to redesign and duplicate, which conferred a benefit for ABC (mostly before the advent of computer graphics).
1067	5040	Between May and September 2005, rumors circulated that Disney–ABC was considering a sale of ABC Radio, with Clear Channel Communications and Westwood One (which had earlier purchased NBC's radio division, as well as the distribution rights to CBS's, and the Mutual Broadcasting System during the 1990s) as potential buyers.
1067	5041	On October 19, 2005, ABC announced the restructuring of the group into six divisions: Entertainment Communications, Communications Resources, Kids Communications, News Communications, Corporate Communications, and International Communications.
1068	5042	In 2004, ABC's average viewership declined by ten ratings points, landing the network in fourth place, behind NBC, CBS and Fox (by the following year, the combined season-ending average audience share of ABC, NBC and CBS represented only 32% of U.S. households).
1068	5043	However, during the 2004–05 season, the network experienced unexpected success with new series such as Desperate Housewives, Lost and Grey's Anatomy as well as reality series Dancing with the Stars, which helped ABC rise to second place, jumping ahead of CBS, but behind a surging Fox.
1068	5044	On April 21, 2004, Disney announced a restructuring of its Disney Media Networks division with Anne Sweeney being named president of ABC parent Disney–ABC Television Group, and ESPN president George Bodenheimer becoming co-CEO of the division with Sweeney, as well as president of ABC Sports.
1068	5045	On December 7, 2005, ABC Sports and ESPN signed an eight-year broadcast rights agreement with NASCAR, allowing ABC and ESPN to broadcast 17 Nextel Cup races each season (comprising just over half of the 36 races held annually) effective with the 2006 season.
1069	5046	Networks affiliates approved a two-year affiliate agreement in 2002.
1069	5047	In September, Disney Chairman/CEO Michael Eisner outlined a proposed realignment of the ABC broadcast network day parts with the similar unit in its cable channels: ABC Saturday mornings with Disney Channels (Toon & Playhouse), ABC daytime with Soapnet and ABC prime time with ABC Family.
1069	5048	2002 saw the debut of the network's first hit reality series, The Bachelor (the elimination-style dating show's success led to a spinoff, The Bachelorette, which premiered the following year, as well as two additional spinoffs that later debuted in the early 2010s).
1070	5049	On April 30, 2000, as a result of a carriage dispute with ABC, Time Warner Cable removed ABC owned-and-operated stations from the cable provider's systems in four markets (WABC-TV in New York City, KABC-TV in Los Angeles, KTRK in Houston and WTVD in Raleigh-Durham).
1070	5050	The network had earlier reached an eleventh-hour deal to renew its carriage agreement with the provider on December 31, 1999.
1070	5051	ABC filed an emergency petition to the Federal Communications Commission on May 1 to force TWC to restore the affected stations; the FCC ruled in favor of ABC, ordering Time Warner Cable to restore the stations, doing so on the afternoon of May 2.
1070	5052	ABC ended the 2000–01 season as the most-watched network, ahead of NBC.
1071	5053	In addition to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, the network entered the 2000s with hits held over from the previous decade such as The Practice, NYPD Blue and The Wonderful World of Disney and new series such as My Wife and Kids and According to Jim, all of which managed to help ABC stay ahead of the competition in the ratings in spite of the later departure of Millionaire.
1071	5054	2000 saw the end of "TGIF", which was struggling to find new hits (with Boy Meets World and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, the latter of which moved to The WB in September 2000, beginning to wane as well by this point) following the loss of Family Matters and Step by Step to CBS as part of its own failed attempt at a family-oriented Friday comedy block in the 1997–98 season.
1071	5055	Outside of Friday stalwart 20/20, Friday nights remained a weak spot for ABC for the next 11 years.
1072	5056	In August 1999, ABC premiered a special series event, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, a game show based on the British program of the same title.
1072	5057	Hosted throughout its ABC tenure by Regis Philbin, the program became a major ratings success throughout its initial summer run, which led ABC to renew Millionaire as a regular series, returning on January 18, 2000.
1072	5058	At its peak, the program aired as much as six nights a week.
1072	5059	Buoyed by Millionaire, during the 1999–2000 season, ABC became the first network to move from third to first place in the ratings during a single television season.
1072	5060	Millionaire ended its run on the network's primetime lineup after three years in 2002, with Buena Vista Television relaunching the show as a syndicated program (under that incarnation's original host Meredith Vieira) in September of that year.
1073	5061	On July 31, 1995, The Walt Disney Company announced an agreement to merge with Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion.
1073	5062	Disney shareholders approved the merger at a special conference in New York City on January 4, 1996, with the acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC being completed on February 9; following the sale, Disney renamed its new subsidiary ABC Inc.
1073	5063	In addition to the ABC network, the Disney acquisition integrated ABC's ten owned-and-operated television and 21 radio stations; its 80% interest in ESPN, ownership interests in The History Channel, A&E Television Networks, and Lifetime Entertainment; and Capital Cities/ABC's magazine and newspaper properties into the company.
1073	5064	As FCC ownership rules forbade the company from keeping both it and KABC-TV, Disney sold Los Angeles independent station KCAL-TV to Young Broadcasting for $387 million.
1073	5065	On April 4, Disney sold the four newspapers that ABC had controlled under Capital Cities to Knight Ridder for $1.65 billion.
1073	5066	Following the merger, Thomas S. Murphy left ABC with Robert Iger taking his place as president and CEO.
1073	5067	Around the time of the merger, Disney's television production units had already produced series for the network such as Home Improvement and Boy Meets World, while the deal also allowed ABC access to Disney's children's programming library for its Saturday morning block.
1073	5068	In 1998, ABC premiered the Aaron Sorkin-created sitcom Sports Night, centering on the travails of the staff of a SportsCenter-style sports news program; despite earning critical praise and multiple Emmy Awards, the series was cancelled in 2000 after two seasons.
1074	5069	It was not until the 1965–66 season that color became the dominant format for the three broadcast television networks.
1074	5070	ABC, meanwhile, remained in third place and still needed money to grow itself into a major competitor.
1074	5071	However, ABC's issues with its transition to color became secondary compared to the network's financial problems; in 1964, the network found itself, as Goldenson later wrote in the 1991 book "Beating the Odds: The Untold Story Behind the Rise of ABC", "in the middle of a war [where] the battlefield was Wall Street".
1074	5072	Many companies sought to take over ABC, including Norton Simon, General Electric, International Telephone and Telegraph and Litton Industries.
1075	5073	On May 1, 1953, ABC's New York City flagship stations – WJZ, WJZ-FM and WJZ-TV – changed their respective callsigns to WABC, WABC-FM and WABC-TV, and moved their operations to facilities at 7 West 66th Street, one block away from Central Park.
1075	5074	The WABC call letters were previously used by the flagship station of CBS Radio (now WCBS (AM)) until 1946.
1075	5075	The WJZ calls would later be reassigned to the then-ABC affiliate in Baltimore in 1959, in an historical nod to the fact that WJZ was originally established by the Baltimore station's owner at the time, Westinghouse.
1076	5076	However, a problem emerged regarding the directions taken by ABC and UPT.
1076	5077	In 1950, Noble appointed Robert Kintner to be ABC's president while he himself served as its CEO, a position he would hold until his death in 1958.
1076	5078	Despite the promise of non-interference between ABC and UPT, Goldenson had to intervene in ABC's decisions because of financial problems and the FCC's long period of indecision.
1076	5079	Goldenson added to the confusion when, in October 1954, he proposed a merger between UPT and the DuMont Television Network, which was also mired in financial trouble.
1076	5080	As part of this merger, the network would have been renamed "ABC-DuMont" for five years, and DuMont would have received $5 million in cash, room on the schedule for existing DuMont programming, and guaranteed advertising time for DuMont Laboratories receivers.
1076	5081	In addition, to comply with FCC ownership restrictions, it would have been required to sell either WABC-TV or DuMont owned-and-operated station WABD in the New York City market, as well as two other stations.
1076	5082	The merged ABC-DuMont would have had the resources to compete with CBS and NBC.
1077	5083	At the same time he made attempts to help grow ABC, Goldenson had been trying since mid-1953 to provide content for the network by contacting his old acquaintances in Hollywood, with whom he had worked when UPT was a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures.
1077	5084	ABC's merger with UPT led to the creation of relationships with Hollywood's film production studios, breaking a quarantine that had existed at that time between film and television, the latter of which had previously been more connected to radio.
1077	5085	ABC's flagship productions at the time were The Lone Ranger, based on the radio program of the same title, and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, the latter of which (at 13 seasons, running from 1952 to 1965) held the record for the longest-running prime time comedy in U.S. television history, until it was surpassed by The Simpsons in 2002.
1078	5086	Warner tried with mixed success to adapt some of its most successful films as ABC television series, and showcase these adaptations as part of the wheel series Warner Bros. Presents.
1078	5087	Airing during the 1955–56 season, it showcased television adaptations of the 1942 films Kings Row and Casablanca; Cheyenne (adapted from the 1947 film Wyoming Kid); Sugarfoot (a remake of the 1954 film The Boy from Oklahoma); and Maverick.
1078	5088	However, the most iconic of ABC's relationships with Hollywood producers was its agreement with Walt Disney; after the start of the network's bond with the Disney studio, James Lewis Baughman, who worked as a columnist at that time, observed that "at ABC's headquarters in New York, the secretaries [were now] wearing hats with Mickey Mouse ears".
1079	5089	Walt Disney and his brother Roy contacted Goldenson at the end of 1953 for ABC to agree to finance part of the Disneyland project in exchange for producing a television program for the network.
1079	5090	Walt wanted ABC to invest $500,000 and accrued a guarantee of $4.5 million in additional loans, a third of the budget intended for the park.
1079	5091	Around 1954, ABC agreed to finance Disneyland in exchange for the right to broadcast a new Sunday night program, Disneyland, which debuted on the network on October 27, 1954 as the first of many anthology television programs that Disney would broadcast over the course of the next 50 years.
1080	5092	In July 1968, ABC Radio launched a special programming project for its FM stations, which was spearheaded by Allen Shaw, a former program manager at WCFL in Chicago who was approached by ABC Radio president Harold L. Neal to develop a format to compete with the new progressive rock and DJ-helmed stations.
1080	5093	The new concept called "LOVE Radio", which featured a limited selection of music genres, was launched on ABC's seven owned-and-operated FM stations in late November 1968; the concept replaced nearly all of the programming provided by these stations; however, several affiliates (such as KXYZ) retained the majority of their content.
1080	5094	In August 1970, Shaw announced that ABC FM's music choice policy should be reviewed to allow listeners access to many styles of music.
1081	5095	On the television side, in September 1969, ABC launched the Movie of the Week, a weekly showcase aimed at capitalizing on the growing success of made-for-TV movies since the early 1960s.
1081	5096	The Movie of the Week broadcast feature-length dramatic films directed by such talented filmmakers as Aaron Spelling, David Wolper and Steven Spielberg (the latter of whom gained early success through the showcase for his 1971 film Duel) that were produced on an average budget of $400,000–$450,000.
1081	5097	Hits for the television network during the late 1960s and early 1970s included The Courtship of Eddie's Father, The Brady Bunch and The Partridge Family.
1082	5098	In the early 1970s, ABC completed its transition to color; the decade as a whole would mark a turning point for ABC, as it began to pass CBS and NBC in the ratings to become the first place network.
1082	5099	It also began to use behavioral and demographic data to better determine what types of sponsors to sell advertising slots to and provide programming that would appeal towards certain audiences.
1082	5100	ABC's gains in audience share were greatly helped by the fact that several smaller markets had grown large enough to allow full-time affiliations from all three networks.
1083	5101	In 1970, ABC debuted Monday Night Football as part of its Monday prime time schedule; the program became a hit for the network and served as the National Football League (NFL)'s premier game of the week until 2006, when Sunday Night Football, which moved to NBC that year as part of a broadcast deal that in turn saw MNF move to ESPN, took over as the league's marquee game.
1083	5102	According to Goldenson, Monday Night Football helped earn ABC regularly score an audience share of 15%–16%; ABC Sports managed the budget for the Monday night time slot to reallocate the weekly budget for ABC's prime time schedule to just six days, as opposed to seven on competing networks.
1083	5103	1970 also saw the premieres of several soap operas including the long-running All My Children, which ran on the network for 41 years.
1084	5104	In 1970, the FCC voted to pass the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, a set of regulations aimed at preventing the major networks from monopolizing the broadcast landscape by barring them from owning any of the prime time programming that they broadcast.
1084	5105	In 1972, the new rules resulted in the company's decision to split ABC Films into two separate companies: the existing Worldvision Enterprises, which would produce and distribute programming for U.S. syndication, and ABC Circle Films as a production unit.
1084	5106	Worldvision was sold to a consortium of ABC executives for nearly $10 million.
1085	5107	In April 1970, Congress passed the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act which banned cigarette advertising from all television and radio networks, including ABC, when it took effect on January 2, 1971.
1085	5108	Citing limited profitability of its cinemas, ABC Great States, the Central West division of ABC Theatres, was sold to Henry Plitt in 1974.
1085	5109	On January 17, 1972, Elton Rule was named President and Chief Operating Officer of ABC a few months after Goldenson reduced his role in the company after suffering a heart attack.
1086	5110	In the early 1970s, Michael Eisner, who joined ABC in 1966, became the network's program development manager.
1086	5111	He helped bring about ideas for many series including Happy Days (which originated as a segment on the anthology series Love, American Style), as well as several soap operas; however, Eisner's main credit at ABC was for developing youth-oriented programming.
1086	5112	He was responsible for reacquiring the rights to the Looney Tunes-Merrie Melodies library, bringing the shorts back to ABC after spending several years on CBS, as well as developing The Jackson 5ive animated series and a series about the Osmonds, and greenlighting Super Friends, based on DC Comics' Justice League of America series.
1086	5113	Eisner left ABC in 1976 to become president of Paramount Pictures (and would later become the President of ABC's eventual parent company, Disney).
1087	5114	In the spring of 1975, Fred Pierce, the newly appointed president of ABC Television, convinced Fred Silverman to become the first president and director of programming of the independent television production subsidiary ABC Entertainment, created from the network's namesake programming division.
1087	5115	In 1974, ABC premiered the detective series S.W.A.T.
1087	5116	That same year, the network made the decision to compete with NBC's morning news-talk program Today.
1087	5117	Its first attempt at such competition was AM America; however, that show's success was not straightforward.
1087	5118	One of its affiliates, WCVB-TV premiered morning show Good Day!.
1087	5119	First premiering in 1973 as Good Morning!, it was groundbreaking for being entirely produced on the road and broadcasting from locations outside of the Boston area.
1087	5120	Also, in the summer of 1975, ABC discovered that its Cleveland affiliate WEWS-TV was producing its own morning program The Morning Exchange, which debuted in 1972 and was now locally pre-empting AM America; it was the first morning show to utilize a set modeled after a living room, and established a concept now commonplace among network morning shows in which news and weather updates were featured at the top and bottom of each hour.
1087	5121	Discovering that their formats seemed to appeal to their viewers, the network became the first to adopt them for a new national morning show, Good Morning America, which debuted on November 3, 1975.
1088	5122	The 1970s were highlighted by several successful comedy, fantasy, action and superhero-themed series for the network including Kung Fu, The Six Million Dollar Man, Wonder Woman, Starsky & Hutch, Charlie's Angels, The Bionic Woman, Fantasy Island and Battlestar Galactica.
1088	5123	Many of these series were greenlit by Silverman, who left ABC in 1978 to become president of NBC's entertainment division.
1088	5124	The rousing success of Happy Days also led to a successful spin-off series, Laverne & Shirley, which debuted in 1976.
1088	5125	Charlie's Angels and Three's Company (which debuted in 1977) were two prime examples of a trend among the major networks during the 1970s known as "jiggle TV", featuring attractive, often buxom, women in main and guest roles.
1089	5126	For its part, the television network produced a few new hits during 1977: January saw the premiere of Roots, a miniseries based on an Alex Haley novel that was published the previous year; in September, The Love Boat, a comedy-drama anthology series produced by Aaron Spelling which was based around the crew of a cruise ship and featured three stories centered partly on the ship's various passengers; although critically lambasted, the series turned out to be a ratings success and lasted nine seasons.
1089	5127	Roots went on to become one of the highest-rated programs in American television history, with unprecedented ratings for its finale.
1089	5128	The success of Roots, Happy Days and The Love Boat allowed the network to take first place in the ratings for the first time in the 1976–77 season.
1089	5129	On September 13, 1977, the network debuted Soap, a controversial soap opera parody which became known for being the first television series to feature an openly gay main character (played by a then-unknown Billy Crystal); it last ran on the network on April 20, 1981.
1090	5130	Meanwhile, ABC News, which formed as a newly separate division, sought to become a global leader in television news.
1090	5131	In 1977, Roone Arledge was named president of the new ABC News in addition to being president of ABC Sports.
1090	5132	That same year, ABC launched a major expansion of its office facilities in New York City.
1090	5133	The company first constructed a new 10-story building on land previously occupied by an abandoned warehouse on the corner of Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street; the facility that was built in its place is nicknamed "7 Lincoln Square" (although it is actually located at 149 Columbus Avenue).
1090	5134	Meanwhile, a former parking lot, located at 30 West 67th Street, was transformed into an impressive 15-story building.
1090	5135	Both buildings were completed in June 1979.
1090	5136	WABC-TV moved its operations from offices at 77 West 66th Street to 149 Columbus Avenue, freeing up space for the ABC network to house some of its operations.
1091	5137	In June 1978, Arledge created the newsmagazine 20/20; after its first episode received harshly negative reviews, the program – which debuted as a summer series, before becoming a year-round program in 1979 – was immediately revamped to feature a mix of in-depth stories and interviews, with Hugh Downs appointed as its anchor (later paired alongside his former Today colleague Barbara Walters).
1091	5138	In February 1979, ABC sold its recording division to MCA Inc. for $20 million; the label was discontinued by March 5 of that year, and all of its 300 employees were laid off (the rights to the works of ABC Records and all of MCA's other labels have since been acquired by Universal Music Group).
1092	5139	In order to compete with CNN, ABC proposed a 24-hour news channel called ABC Cable News, with plans to launch the network in 1995; however, the plan would ultimately be shelved by company management.
1092	5140	ABC would reattempt such a concept in July 2004 with the launch of ABC News Now, a 24-hour news channel distributed for viewing on the Internet and mobile phones.
1092	5141	On August 29, 1994, ABC purchased Flint, Michigan affiliate WJRT-TV and WTVG in Toledo, Ohio (which was previously affiliated with ABC from 1958 to 1970) from SJL Broadcast Management, with the latter switching to ABC once its contract with NBC expired two months after the purchase was finalized in early 1995.
1092	5142	Both stations were acquired as a contingency plan in the event that CBS reached an affiliation deal with WXYZ-TV (to replace WJBK, which switched to Fox as a result of that network's group affiliation agreement with New World Communications) in order to allow the network to retain some over-the-air presence in the Detroit market (the E.W.
1092	5143	Scripps Company and ABC would reach a group affiliation deal that renewed affiliation agreements with WXYZ and WEWS, and switch four other stations, including two whose Fox affiliations were displaced by the New World deal, with the network).
1093	5144	The Writers Guild of America strike that halted production of network programs for much of the 2007–08 season affected the network in 2007–08 and 2008–09, as various ABC shows that premiered in 2007, such as Dirty Sexy Money, Pushing Daisies, Eli Stone and Samantha Who?, did not live to see a third season; other series such as Boston Legal and the U.S. version of Life on Mars suffered from low viewership, despite the former, a spin off of The Practice, being a once-highlighted breakout series when it debuted in 2005.
1093	5145	One of the network's strike-replacement programs during that time was the game show Duel, which premiered in December 2007.
1093	5146	The program would become a minor success for the network during its initial six-episode run, which led ABC to renew Duel as a regular series starting in April 2008.
1093	5147	However, Duel suffered from low viewership during its run as a regular series, and ABC canceled the program after sixteen episodes.
1093	5148	On August 15, 2008, Disney denied rumors started by Caris & Co. that it would be selling the ten ABC owned-and-operated stations.
1094	5149	In early 2009, Disney–ABC Television Group merged ABC Entertainment and ABC Studios into a new division, ABC Entertainment Group, which would be responsible for both its production and broadcasting operations.
1094	5150	During this reorganization, the group announced that it would lay off 5% of its workforce.
1094	5151	On April 2, 2009, Citadel Communications announced that it would rebrand ABC Radio as Citadel Media; however, ABC News continued to provide news content for Citadel.
1094	5152	On December 22, Disney–ABC Television Group announced a partnership with Apple Inc. to make individual episodes of ABC and Disney Channel programs available for purchase on iTunes.
1095	5153	The network began running into some trouble in the ratings by 2010.
1095	5154	That year, the sixth and final season of Lost became the drama's lowest-rated season since its debut in 2004.
1095	5155	Ratings for the once-instant hit Ugly Betty collapsed dramatically after it was moved to Fridays at the start of its fourth season in the fall of 2009; an attempt to boost ratings by moving the dramedy to Wednesdays failed, with its ultimate cancellation by the network eliciting negative reaction from the public, and particularly the show's fanbase.
1095	5156	With the network's two former hit shows now out of the picture, the network's remaining top veteran shows Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy, and another hit drama Brothers & Sisters, all ended the 2009–10 season recorded their lowest ratings ever.
1096	5157	When the FCC imposed its fin-syn rules in 1970, ABC proactively created two companies: Worldvision Enterprises as a syndication distributor, and ABC Circle Films as a production company.
1096	5158	However, between the publication and implementation of these regulations, the separation of the network's catalog was made in 1973.
1096	5159	The broadcast rights to pre-1973 productions were transferred to Worldvision, which became independent in the same year.
1096	5160	The company has been sold several times since Paramount Television acquired it in 1999, and has most recently been absorbed into CBS Television Distribution, a unit of CBS Corporation.
1096	5161	Nonetheless, Worldvision sold portions of its catalog, including the Ruby-Spears and Hanna-Barbera libraries, to Turner Broadcasting System in 1990.
1096	5162	With Disney's 1996 purchase of ABC, ABC Circle Films was absorbed into Touchstone Television, a Disney subsidiary which in turn was renamed ABC Studios in 2007.
1097	5163	Also part of the library is the aforementioned Selznick library, the Cinerama Productions/Palomar theatrical library and the Selmur Productions catalog that the network acquired some years back, and the in-house productions it continues to produce (such as America's Funniest Home Videos, General Hospital, and ABC News productions), although Disney–ABC Domestic Television (formerly known as Buena Vista Television) handles domestic television distribution, while Disney–ABC International Television (formerly known as Buena Vista International Television) handles international television distribution.
1098	5164	Since its inception, ABC has had many affiliated stations, which include WABC-TV and WPVI-TV, the first two stations to carry the network's programming.
1098	5165	As of March 2015[update], ABC has eight owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 235 additional television stations encompassing 49 states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. possessions, Bermuda and Saba; this makes ABC the largest U.S. broadcast television network by total number of affiliates.
1098	5166	The network has an estimated national reach of 96.26% of all households in the United States (or 300,794,157 Americans with at least one television set).
1099	5167	The ABC logo has evolved many times since the network's creation in 1943.
1099	5168	The network's first logo, introduced in 1946, consisted of a television screen containing the letters "T" and "V", with a vertical ABC microphone in the center, referencing the network's roots in radio.
1099	5169	When the ABC-UPT merger was finalized in 1953, the network introduced a new logo based on the seal of the Federal Communications Commission, with the letters "ABC" enclosed in a circular shield surmounted by the bald eagle.
1099	5170	In 1957, just before the television network began its first color broadcasts, the ABC logo consisted of a tiny lowercase "abc" in the center of a large lowercase letter a, a design known as the "ABC Circle A".
1100	5171	With the 2011 cancellation of Supernanny, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition became the only remaining program on the network's schedule that was broadcast in 4:3 standard definition.
1100	5172	All of the network's programming has been presented in HD since January 2012 (with the exception of certain holiday specials produced prior to 2005 – such as the Peanuts specials and Rudolph's Shiny New Year – which continue to be presented in 4:3 SD), when Extreme Makeover: Home Edition ended its run as a regular series and One Life to Live (which had been presented in 16:9 standard definition since 2010) also ended its ABC run.
1100	5173	The affiliate-syndicated Saturday morning E/I block Litton's Weekend Aventure is also broadcast in HD, and was the first children's program block on any U.S. broadcast network to feature programs available in the format upon its September 2011 debut.
1101	5174	ABC's master feed is transmitted in 720p high definition, the native resolution format for The Walt Disney Company's U.S. television properties.
1101	5175	However, most of Hearst Television's 16 ABC-affiliated stations transmit the network's programming in 1080i HD, while 11 other affiliates owned by various companies carry the network feed in 480i standard definition either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry ABC programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed ABC affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD.
1102	5176	The network's troubles with sustaining existing series and gaining new hits spilled over into its 2010–11 schedule: ABC's dramas during that season continued to fail, with the midseason forensic investigation drama Body of Proof being the only one that was renewed for a second season.
1102	5177	The network also struggled to establish new comedies to support the previous year's debuts, with only late-season premiere Happy Endings earning a second season.
1102	5178	Meanwhile, the new lows hit by Brothers & Sisters led to its cancellation, and the previous year's only drama renewal, V, also failed to earn another season after a low-rated midseason run.
1102	5179	Despite this and another noticeable ratings decline, ABC would manage to outrate NBC for third place by a larger margin than the previous year.
1103	5180	On April 14, 2011, ABC canceled the long-running soap operas All My Children and One Life to Live after 41 and 43 years on the air, respectively (following backlash from fans, ABC sold the rights to both shows to Prospect Park, which eventually revived the soaps on Hulu for one additional season in 2013 and with both companies suing one another for allegations of interference with the process of reviving the shows, failure to pay licensing fees and issues over ABC's use of certain characters from One Live to Live on General Hospital during the transition).
1103	5181	The talk/lifestyle show that replaced One Life to Live, The Revolution, failed to generate satisfactory ratings and was in turn canceled after only seven months.
1103	5182	The 2011–12 season saw ABC drop to fourth place in the 18–49 demographic despite renewing a handful of new shows (including freshmen dramas Scandal, Revenge and Once Upon a Time) for second seasons.
1104	5183	The 2013–14 season was a slight improvement for ABC with three new hits in The Goldbergs, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
1104	5184	and Resurrection, all of which were renewed; however, that season saw the cancellations of holdovers The Neighbors (which languished in its new Friday time slot despite being bookended by Last Man Standing and Shark Tank) and Suburgatory.
1104	5185	NBC, which had lagged behind ABC for eight years, finished the season in first place in the 18–49 demographic for the first time since 2004, and in second place in total viewership behind long-dominant CBS.
1104	5186	ABC itself would finish the season in third place as Fox crashed to fourth in both demographics.
1105	5187	Among the few bright spots during this season were the midseason crime dramedy Castle as well as the success of two family sitcoms that anchored the network's revamped Wednesday comedy lineup, The Middle and Modern Family, the latter of which was both a critical and commercial success.
1105	5188	Shark Tank (based on the Dragon's Den reality format) also became a midseason sleeper hit on Sundays in the spring of 2010; the following season, it became the tentpole of the network's Friday night schedule, gradually helping make ABC a strong competitor (after being paired with 20/20 and beginning with the 2012–13 season, the Tim Allen sitcom Last Man Standing) against CBS' long-dominant drama/reality lineup on that night for the first time since the "TGIF" lineup ended in 2000.
1106	5189	Daniel Burke departed from Capital Cities/ABC in February 1994, with Thomas Murphy taking over as president before ceding control to Robert Iger.
1106	5190	September 1994 saw the debut of NYPD Blue, a gritty police procedural from Steven Bochco (who created Doogie Howser, M.D.
1106	5191	and the critically pilloried Cop Rock for ABC earlier in the decade); lasting ten seasons, the drama became known for its boundary pushing of network television standards (particularly its occasional use of graphic language and rear nudity), which led some affiliates to initially refuse to air the show in its first season.
1107	5192	In 1993, the FCC repealed the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, once again allowing networks to hold interests in television production studios.
1107	5193	That same year, Capital Cities/ABC purchased the French animation studio DIC Entertainment; it also signed an agreement with Time Warner Cable to carry its owned-and-operated television stations on the provider's systems in ABC O&O markets.
1107	5194	By that year, ABC had a total viewership share of 23.63% of American households, just below the limit of 25% imposed by the FCC.
1108	5195	During the 1960s, ABC continued on the same path that it began to take in the mid-1950s, by consolidating the network as part of its effort to gain loyalty from the public.
1108	5196	The network's finances improved and allowed it to invest in other properties and programming.
1108	5197	In May 1960, ABC purchased Chicago radio station WLS, which had shared airtime with WENR since the 1920s.
1108	5198	This acquisition allowed ABC to consolidate its presence in the market.
1108	5199	On May 9, 1960, WLS launched a new lineup consisting of ABC Radio programming.
1108	5200	In 1960, Canadian entrepreneur John Bassett, who was trying to establish a television station in Toronto, sought the help of ABC to launch the station.
1108	5201	Leonard Goldenson agreed to acquire a 25% interest in CFTO-TV; however, legislation by the Canadian Radio-Television Commission prohibited ABC's involvement, resulting in the company withdrawing from the project before the station's launch.
1109	5202	Always in search of new programs that would help it compete with NBC and CBS, ABC's management believed that sports could be a major catalyst in improving the network's market share.
1109	5203	On April 29, 1961, ABC debuted Wide World of Sports, an anthology series created by Edgar Scherick through his company Sports Programs, Inc. and produced by a young Roone Arledge which featured a different sporting event each broadcast.
1109	5204	ABC purchased Sports Programs, Inc. in exchange for shares in the company, leading it to become the future core of ABC Sports, with Arledge as the executive producer of that division's shows.
1109	5205	Wide World of Sports, in particular, was not merely devoted to a single sport, but rather to generally all sporting events.
1110	5206	In 1965, the corporate entity, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, was renamed as the American Broadcasting Companies,  while its cinema division became ABC Theatres;[citation needed] its recording division was renamed ABC Records in 1966.
1110	5207	In December of that year, the ABC television network premiered The Dating Game, a pioneer series in its genre, which was a reworking of the blind date concept in which a suitor selected one of three contestants sight unseen based on the answers to selected questions.
1110	5208	This was followed up in July 1966 by The Newlywed Game, featuring three recently married couples who guessed the responses to their partner's questions (some of which were fairly risque).
1110	5209	As ABC began to outgrow its facilities at 7 West 66th Street, Goldenson found a new headquarters for ABC in a 44 story building located at 1330 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, at the corner of 54th Street (now occupied by The Financial Times's New York office).
1110	5210	This operation allowed for the conversion of the premises at 66th Street into production facilities for television and radio programs.
1111	5211	ABC dominated the American television landscape during the 1970s and early 1980s (by 1980, the three major networks represented 90% of all prime-time television viewership in the U.S.).
1111	5212	Several flagship series debuted on the network during this time including Dynasty, an opulent drama from Aaron Spelling that became a hit when it premiered as a midseason series in 1981, five months before Spelling's other ABC hit Charlie's Angels ended its run.
1111	5213	The network was also propelled during the early 1980s by the continued successes of Happy Days, Three's Company, Laverne & Shirley and Fantasy Island, and gained new hits in Too Close for Comfort, Soap spinoff Benson and Happy Days spinoff Mork & Mindy.
1111	5214	In 1981, ABC (through its ABC Video Services division) launched the Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS), a cable channel operated as a joint venture with the Hearst Corporation offering cultural and arts programming, which aired as a nighttime service over the channel space of Nickelodeon.
1112	5215	In 1983, ABC sold KXYZ to the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation.
1112	5216	On January 4, 1984, The New York Times reported that ABC, through its subsidiary ABC Video Enterprises, had exercised its option to purchase up to 15% (or between $25 million and $30 million) of Getty Oil's shares in ESPN, which would allow it to expand its shares at a later date.
1112	5217	In June 1984, ABC's executive committee approved the company's interest acquisition in ESPN, and ABC arranged with Getty Oil to obtain an 80% stake in the channel, while selling the remaining 20% to Nabisco.
1112	5218	That year, ABC and Hearst reached an agreement with RCA to merge ARTS and competing arts service, The Entertainment Channel, into a single cable channel called Arts & Entertainment Television (A&E); the new channel subsequently leased a separate satellite transponder, ending its sharing agreement with Nickelodeon to become a 24-hour service.
1112	5219	Meanwhile, ABC withdrew from the theme park business for good when it sold the Silver Springs Nature Theme Park.
1113	5220	In 1990, Thomas S. Murphy delegated his position as president to Daniel B. Burke while remaining ABC's chairman and CEO.
1113	5221	Capital Cities/ABC reported revenues of $465 million.
1113	5222	Now at a strong second place, the network entered the 1990s with additional family-friendly hits including America's Funniest Home Videos (which has gone on to become the longest-running prime time entertainment program in the network's history), Step by Step, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, Boy Meets World and Perfect Strangers spinoff Family Matters, as well as series such as Doogie Howser, M.D., Life Goes On, cult favorite Twin Peaks and The Commish.
1113	5223	In September 1991, the network premiered Home Improvement, a sitcom starring stand-up comic Tim Allen centering on the family and work life of an accident-prone host of a cable-access home improvement show.
1113	5224	Lasting nine seasons, its success led ABC to greenlight additional sitcom projects helmed by comedians during the 1990s including The Drew Carey Show; Brett Butler vehicle Grace Under Fire; and Ellen, which became notable for a 1997 episode which served as the coming out of series star Ellen DeGeneres (as well as her character in the series) as a lesbian.
1114	5225	Daytime programming is also provided from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. weekdays (with a one-hour break at 12:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific for stations to air newscasts, other locally produced programming such as talk shows, or syndicated programs) featuring the talk/lifestyle shows The View and The Chew and the soap opera General Hospital.
1114	5226	ABC News programming includes Good Morning America from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. weekdays (along with one-hour weekend editions); nightly editions of ABC World News Tonight (whose weekend editions are occasionally subject to abbreviation or preemption due to sports telecasts overrunning into the program's timeslot), the Sunday political talk show This Week, early morning news programs World News Now and America This Morning and the late night newsmagazine Nightline.
1114	5227	Late nights feature the weeknight talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!.
1115	5228	Currently, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Delaware are the only U.S. states where ABC does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Jersey is served by New York City O&O WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV; Rhode Island is served by New Bedford, Massachusetts-licensed WLNE; and Delaware is served by WPVI and Salisbury, Maryland affiliate WMDT).
1115	5229	ABC maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as Birmingham, Alabama (WBMA-LD), Lima, Ohio (WLQP-LP) and South Bend, Indiana (WBND-LD).
1115	5230	In some markets, including the former two mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station.
1116	5231	All of ABC's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates have had their own facilities and studios, but transverse entities have been created to produce national programming.
1116	5232	As a result, television series were produced by ABC Circle Films beginning in 1962 and by Touchstone Television beginning in 1985, before Touchstone was reorganized as ABC Studios in February 2007.
1116	5233	Since the 1950s, ABC has had two main production facilities: the ABC Television Center (now The Prospect Studios) on Prospect Avenue in Hollywood, California, shared with the operations of KABC-TV until 1999; and the ABC Television Center, East, a set of studios located throughout the New York City.
1117	5234	ABC also owns the Times Square Studios at 1500 Broadway on land in Times Square owned by a development fund for the 42nd Street Project; opened in 1999, Good Morning America and Nightline are broadcast from this particular facility.
1117	5235	ABC News has premises a little further on West 66th Street, in a six-story building occupying a 196 feet (60 m) × 379 feet (116 m) plot at 121–135 West End Avenue.
1117	5236	The block of West End Avenue housing the ABC News building was renamed Peter Jennings Way in 2006 in honor of the recently deceased longtime ABC News chief anchor and anchor of World News Tonight.
1118	5237	ABC maintains several video on demand services for delayed viewing of the network's programming, including a traditional VOD service called ABC on Demand, which is carried on most traditional cable and IPTV providers.
1118	5238	The Walt Disney Company is also a part-owner of Hulu (as part of a consortium that includes, among other parties, the respective parent companies of NBC and Fox, NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox), and has offered full-length episodes of most of ABC's programming through the streaming service since July 6, 2009 (which are available for viewing on Hulu's website and mobile app), as part of an agreement reached in April that year that also allowed Disney to acquire a 27% ownership stake in Hulu.
1119	5239	The most recent episodes of the network's shows are usually made available on WATCH ABC, Hulu and ABC on Demand the day after their original broadcast.
1119	5240	In addition, ABC on Demand (like the video-on-demand television services provided by the other U.S. broadcast networks) disallows fast forwarding of accessed content.
1119	5241	Restrictions implemented by Disney–ABC Television Group on January 7, 2014 restrict streaming of the most recent episode of any ABC program on Hulu and WATCH ABC until eight days after their initial broadcast, in order to encourage live or same-week (via both DVR and cable on demand) viewing, with day-after-air streaming on either service limited to subscribers of participating pay television providers (such as Comcast, Verizon FiOS and Time Warner Cable) using an ISP account via an authenticated user login.
1120	5242	A revised version of the ABC logo was introduced for promotions for the 2013–14 season during the network's upfront presentation on May 14, 2013, and officially introduced on-air on June 17 (although some affiliates implemented the new design prior to then), as part of an overhaul of ABC's identity by design agency LoyalKaspar.
1120	5243	The updated logo carries a simpler gloss design than the previous version, and contains lettering more closely resembling Paul Rand's original version of the circle logo.
1120	5244	The logo is displayed on-air, online and in print advertising in four variants shading the respective color used with the circle design's native black coloring: a gold version is primarily used on entertainment-oriented outlets (such as ABC.com, WATCH ABC, and by ABC Studios) and the on-screen bug; steel blue and dark grey versions are used primarily by ABC News; a red version is used for ESPN on ABC, while all four variants are used selectively in advertising and by affiliates.
1120	5245	A new custom typeface, "ABC Modern" (which was inspired by the logotype), was also created for use in advertising and other promotional materials.
1121	5246	By 1954, all U.S. networks had regained control of their programming, with higher advertising revenues: ABC's revenue increased by 67% (earning $26 million), NBC's went up by 30% ($100 million) and CBS's rose by 44% ($117 million).
1121	5247	However that year, ABC had only 14 primary affiliates compared to the 74 that carried the majority of CBS programs and the 71 that were primarily affiliated with NBC.
1121	5248	Most markets outside the largest ones were not large enough to support three full-time network affiliates.
1121	5249	In some markets that were large enough for a third full-time affiliate, the only available commercial allocation was on the less-desirable UHF band.
1121	5250	Until the All-Channel Receiver Act (passed by Congress in 1961) mandated the inclusion of UHF tuning, most viewers needed to purchase a converter to be able to watch UHF stations, and the signal quality was marginal at best even with a converter.
1121	5251	Additionally, during the analog television era, UHF stations were not adequately receivable in rugged terrain.
1121	5252	These factors made many prospective station owners skittish about investing in a UHF station, especially one that would have had to take on an affiliation with a weaker network.
1122	5253	As a result, with the exception of the largest markets, ABC was relegated to secondary status on one or both of the existing stations, usually via off-hours clearances (a notable exception during this time was WKST-TV in Youngstown, Ohio, now WYTV, despite the small size of the surrounding market and its close proximity to Cleveland and Pittsburgh even decades before the city's economic collapse).
1122	5254	According to Goldenson, this meant that an hour of ABC programming reported five times lower viewership than its competitors.
1122	5255	However, the network's intake of money at the time would allow it to accelerate its content production.
1122	5256	Still, ABC's limited reach would continue to hobble it for the next two decades; several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a full-time ABC affiliate until the 1960s, with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s, which allowed stations like WTRF-TV in Wheeling, West Virginia to begin airing ABC programming on a digital subchannel after airing the network's programs outside of recommended timeslots decades before.
1123	5257	On September 3, 1958, the Disneyland anthology series was retitled Walt Disney Presents as it became disassociated with the theme park of the same name.
1123	5258	The movement in westerns, which ABC is credited for having started, represented a fifth of all primetime series on American television in January 1959, at which point detective shows were beginning to rise in popularity as well.
1123	5259	ABC requested additional productions from Disney.
1123	5260	In late 1958, Desilu Productions pitched its detective series The Untouchables to CBS; after that network rejected the show because of its use of violence, Desilu then presented it to ABC, which agreed to pick up the show, and debuted The Untouchables in April 1959.
1123	5261	The series went on to quickly become "immensely popular".
1124	5262	Due to pressure from film studios wanting to increase their production, as the major networks began airing theatrically released films, ABC joined CBS and NBC in broadcasting films on Sunday nights in 1962, with the launch of the ABC Sunday Night Movie, which debuted a year behind its competitors and was initially presented in black-and-white.
1124	5263	Despite a significant increase in viewership (with its audience share having increased to 33% from the 15% share it had in 1953), ABC remained in third place; the company had a total revenue of $15.5 million, a third of the revenue pulled in by CBS at the same period.
1124	5264	To catch up, ABC followed up The Flintstones with another animated series from Hanna-Barbera, The Jetsons, which debuted on September 23, 1962 as the first television series to be broadcast in color on the network.
1124	5265	On April 1, 1963, ABC debuted the soap opera General Hospital, which would go on to become the television network's long-running entertainment program.
1124	5266	That year also saw the premiere of The Fugitive (on September 17), a drama series centering on a man on the run after being accused of committing a murder he did not commit.
1125	5267	On December 7, 1965, Goldenson announced a merger proposal with ITT to ABC management; the two companies agreed to the deal on April 27, 1966.
1125	5268	The FCC approved the merger on December 21, 1966; however, the previous day (December 20), Donald F. Turner, head antitrust regulator for the United States Department of Justice, expressed doubts related to such issues as the emerging cable television market, and concerns over the journalistic integrity of ABC and how it could be influenced by the overseas ownership of ITT.
1125	5269	ITT management promised that the company would allow ABC to retain autonomy in the publishing business.
1125	5270	The merger was suspended, and a complaint was filed by the Department of Justice in July 1967, with ITT going to trial in October 1967; the merger was officially canceled after the trial's conclusion on January 1, 1968.
1126	5271	In December 1984, Thomas S. Murphy, chief executive officer of Capital Cities Communications, contacted Leonard Goldenson about a proposal to merge their respective companies.
1126	5272	On March 16, 1985, ABC's executive committee accepted the merger offer, which was formally announced on March 18, 1985, with Capital Cities purchasing ABC and its related properties for $3.5 billion and $118 for each of ABC's shares as well as a guarantee of 10% (or $3) for a total of $121 per share.
1126	5273	To finance the purchase, Capital Cities borrowed $2.1 billion from a consortium of banks, which sold certain assets that Capital Cites could not acquire or retain due to FCC ownership rules for a combined $900 million and sold off several cable television systems, which were sold to The Washington Post Company (forming the present-day Cable One).
1126	5274	The remaining $500 million was loaned by Warren Buffett, who promised that his company Berkshire Hathaway would purchase $3 million in shares, at $172.50 apiece.
1126	5275	Due to an FCC ban on same-market ownership of television and radio stations by a single company (although the deal would have otherwise complied with new ownership rules implemented by the FCC in January 1985, that allowed broadcasters to own a maximum of 12 television stations), ABC and Capital Cities respectively decided to sell WXYZ-TV and Tampa independent station WFTS-TV to the E. W. Scripps Company (although Capital Cities/ABC originally intended to seek a cross-ownership waiver to retain WXYZ and Capital Cities-owned radio stations WJR and WHYT).
1127	5276	The merger between ABC and Capital Cities received federal approval on September 5, 1985.
1127	5277	After the ABC/Capital Cities merger was finalized on January 3, 1986, the combined company – which became known as Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. – added four television stations (WPVI-TV/Philadelphia, KTRK-TV/Houston, KFSN-TV/Fresno and WTVD/Raleigh) and several radio stations to ABC's broadcasting portfolio, and also included Fairchild Publications and four newspapers (including The Kansas City Star and Fort Worth Star-Telegram).
1127	5278	It also initiated several changes in its management: Frederick S. Pierce was named president of ABC's broadcasting division; Michael P. Millardi became vice president of ABC Broadcasting, and president of ABC Owned Stations and ABC Video Enterprises; John B. Sias was appointed president of the ABC Television Network; Brandon Stoddard became president of ABC Entertainment (a position to which he had been appointed in November 1985); and Roone Arledge became president of ABC News and ABC Sports.
1127	5279	In February 1986, Thomas S. Murphy, who had been serving as CEO of Capital Cities since 1964, was appointed chairman and CEO emeritus of ABC.
1127	5280	Jim Duffy stepped down as ABC Television president for a management position at ABC Communications, a subsidiary that specialized in community service programming, including shows related to literary education.
1128	5281	As far as programming is concerned, four of ABC's marquee shows of the 1970s ended their runs during the mid-1980s: Laverne & Shirley ended its run in 1983, Happy Days and Three's Company ended in 1984 (with the latter producing a short-lived spinoff that year), while The Love Boat ended its run in 1986.
1128	5282	After nearly a decade of ratings trouble, NBC had regained the ratings lead among the Big Three networks in 1984 on the success of series such as The Cosby Show, Cheers and Miami Vice.
1128	5283	To counteract NBC, ABC decided to refocus itself on comedies and family-oriented series beginning in the mid-1980s including Mr. Belvedere, Roseanne, Who's the Boss?, Just the Ten of Us, The Wonder Years, Full House and Perfect Strangers.
1129	5284	Following the initial success of these series, ABC revamped its Friday night schedule around family-friendly comedies in the late 1980s, culminating in the 1989 debut of the "TGIF" block (which promotions referenced stood for "Thank Goodness It's Funny").
1129	5285	Many of the series featured during the run of the block were produced by Miller-Boyett Productions, a Warner Bros.-based studio that briefly programmed the entire Friday lineup during the 1990–91 season (with Going Places joining Family Matters, Full House and Perfect Strangers on the "TGIF" schedule) and through its development deal with Paramount Television prior to 1986 (as Miller-Milkis, and later, Miller-Milkis-Boyett Productions), had earlier produced Happy Days and its various spinoffs among other series for the network.
1130	5286	In 1968, ABC took advantage of new FCC ownership regulations that allowed broadcasting companies to own a maximum of seven radio stations nationwide in order to purchase Houston radio stations KXYZ and KXYZ-FM for $1 million in shares and $1.5 million in bonds.
1130	5287	That year, Roone Arledge was named president of ABC Sports; the company also founded ABC Pictures, a film production company which released its first picture that year, the Ralph Nelson-directed Charly.
1130	5288	It was renamed ABC Motion Pictures in 1979; the unit was dissolved in 1985.
1130	5289	The studio also operated two subsidiaries, Palomar Pictures International and Selmur Pictures.
1130	5290	In July 1968, ABC continued its acquisitions in the amusement parks sector with the opening of ABC Marine World in Redwood City, California; that park was sold in 1972 and demolished in 1986, with the land that occupied the park later becoming home to the headquarters of Oracle Corporation.
1131	5291	It was not until the late 1950s that the ABC network became a serious contender to NBC and CBS, and this was in large part due to the diverse range of programming that met the expectations of the public, such as westerns and detective series.
1131	5292	Despite an almost 500% increase in advertising revenues between 1953 and 1958, the network only had a national reach of between 10% and 18% of the total U.S. population, as it still had relatively fewer affiliates than NBC and CBS.
1131	5293	In 1957, ABC Entertainment president Ollie Treiz discovered that the locally produced variety show Bandstand had pulled very strong ratings in the Philadelphia market on WFIL-TV; Treiz ultimately negotiated a deal to take the show national, under the revised title American Bandstand; the show quickly became a social phenomenon by presenting new musical talent and dances to America's youth and helped make a star out of its host, Dick Clark.
1132	5294	These kinds of programs presented ABC with an image of the "philosophy of counterprogramming against its competitors", offering a strong lineup of programs that contrasted with those seen on its rival networks, which helped Goldenson give the network a continuum between film and television.
1132	5295	ABC's western series (as well as series such as the actioner Zorro) went up against and defeated the variety shows aired by NBC and CBS in the fall of 1957, and its detective shows did the same in the fall of 1959.
1132	5296	To captivate the network's audiences, short 66-minute series were scheduled a half-hour before their hour-long competition.
1132	5297	In May 1961, Life criticized the public enthusiasm and sponsorship for these types of shows at the expense of news programming and denounced an unofficial law "replacing the good programs with the bad ones".
1133	5298	In May 2013, ABC launched "WATCH ABC", a revamp of its traditional multi-platform streaming services encompassing the network's existing streaming portal at ABC.com and a mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers; in addition to providing full-length episodes of ABC programs, the service allows live programming streams of local ABC affiliates in select markets (the first such offering by a U.S. broadcast network).
1133	5299	Similar to sister network ESPN's WatchESPN service (which originated the "WATCH" brand used by the streaming services of Disney's television networks), live streams of ABC stations are only available to authenticated subscribers of participating pay television providers in certain markets.
1133	5300	New York City O&O WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV were the first stations to offer streams of their programming on the service (with a free preview for non-subscribers through June 2013), with the six remaining ABC O&Os offering streams by the start of the 2013–14 season.
1133	5301	Hearst Television also reached a deal to offer streams of its ABC affiliates (including stations in Boston, Kansas City, Milwaukee and West Palm Beach) on the service.
1134	5302	The Sinclair Broadcast Group is the largest operator of ABC stations by numerical total, owning or providing services to 28 ABC affiliates and two additional subchannel-only affiliates; Sinclair owns the largest ABC subchannel affiliate by market size, WABM-DT2/WDBB-DT2 in the Birmingham market, which serve as repeaters of WBMA-LD (the largest low-power "Big Four" affiliate by market size, which itself is also simulcast on a subchannel of former WBMA satellite WGWW, owned by Sinclair partner company Howard Stirk Holdings).
1134	5303	The E. W. Scripps Company is the largest operator of ABC stations in terms of overall market reach, owning 15 ABC-affiliated stations (including affiliates in larger markets such as Cleveland, Phoenix, Detroit and Denver), and through its ownership of Phoenix affiliate KNXV, Las Vegas affiliate KTNV-TV and Tucson affiliate KGUN-TV, the only provider of ABC programming for the majority of Arizona (outside of the Yuma-El Centro market) and Southern Nevada.
1135	5304	On June 16, 2007, ABC began to phase in a new imaging campaign for the upcoming 2007–08 season, "Start Here".
1135	5305	Also developed by Troika, the on-air design was intended to emphasize the availability of ABC content across multiple platforms (in particular, using a system of icons representing different devices, such as television, computers and mobile devices), and "simplify and bring a lot more consistency and continuity to the visual representation of ABC".
1135	5306	The ABC logo was also significantly redesigned as part of the transition, with a glossy "ball" effect that was specifically designed for HD.
1135	5307	On-air, the logo was accompanied by animated water and ribbon effects.
1135	5308	Red ribbons were used to represent the entertainment division, while blue ribbons were used for ABC News.
1136	5309	The network has the unusual distinction of having separately owned and operated affiliates which serve the same market in Tampa, Florida (WFTS-TV and WWSB) and Grand Rapids, Michigan (WZZM and WOTV), with an analogous situation arising in Kansas City, Missouri (KMBC-TV and KQTV).
1137	5310	He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia.
1137	5311	After founding the Mongol Empire and being proclaimed "Genghis Khan", he started the Mongol invasions that resulted in the conquest of most of Eurasia.
1137	5312	These included raids or invasions of the Qara Khitai, Caucasus, Khwarezmid Empire, Western Xia and Jin dynasties.
1137	5313	These campaigns were often accompanied by wholesale massacres of the civilian populations – especially in the Khwarezmian and Xia controlled lands.
1137	5314	By the end of his life, the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China.
1138	5315	Before Genghis Khan died, he assigned Ögedei Khan as his successor and split his empire into khanates among his sons and grandsons.
1138	5316	He died in 1227 after defeating the Western Xia.
1138	5317	He was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia at an unknown location.
1138	5318	His descendants extended the Mongol Empire across most of Eurasia by conquering or creating vassal states out of all of modern-day China, Korea, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and substantial portions of modern Eastern Europe, Russia, and Southwest Asia.
1138	5319	Many of these invasions repeated the earlier large-scale slaughters of local populations.
1138	5320	As a result, Genghis Khan and his empire have a fearsome reputation in local histories.
1139	5321	Temüjin was probably born in 1162 in Delüün Boldog, near Burkhan Khaldun mountain and the Onon and Kherlen rivers in modern-day northern Mongolia, not far from the current capital Ulaanbaatar.
1139	5322	The Secret History of the Mongols reports that Temüjin was born with a blood clot grasped in his fist, a traditional sign that he was destined to become a great leader.
1139	5323	He was the second-oldest son of his father Yesügei, a Khamag Mongol's major chief of the Kiyad and an ally of Toghrul Khan of the Keraite tribe, and the oldest son of his mother Hoelun.
1139	5324	According to the Secret History, Temüjin was named after a Tatar chieftain, Temüjin-üge, whom his father had just captured.
1140	5325	Temüjin had three brothers named Hasar, Hachiun, and Temüge, and one sister named Temülen, as well as two half-brothers named Begter and Belgutei.
1140	5326	Like many of the nomads of Mongolia, Temüjin's early life was difficult.
1140	5327	His father arranged a marriage for him, and at nine years of age he was delivered by his father to the family of his future wife Börte, who was a member of the tribe Khongirad.
1140	5328	Temüjin was to live there in service to Dai Setsen, the head of the new household, until he reached the marriageable age of 12.
1141	5329	For the next several years, Hoelun and her children lived in poverty, surviving primarily on wild fruits and ox carcasses, marmots, and other small game killed by Temüjin and his brothers.
1141	5330	Begter, Temujin's older half-brother, began to exercise the power of the eldest male in the family and eventually Temujin's mother Hoelun (not Begter's mother) would have to accept him as her husband if and when he became an adult.
1141	5331	Temujin's resentment erupted during one hunting excursion that Temüjin and his brother Khasar killed their half-brother Begter.
1142	5332	In another incident, around 1177, he was captured in a raid and held prisoner by his father's former allies, the Tayichi'ud.
1142	5333	The Tayichi'ud enslaved Temüjin (reportedly with a cangue, a sort of portable stocks), but with the help of a sympathetic guard, the father of Chilaun (who later became a general of Genghis Khan), he was able to escape from the ger (yurt) in the middle of the night by hiding in a river crevice.
1142	5334	[citation needed] It was around this time that Jelme and Bo'orchu, two of Genghis Khan's future generals, joined forces with him.
1142	5335	Temüjin's reputation also became widespread after his escape from the Tayichi'ud.
1143	5336	At this time, none of the tribal confederations of Mongolia were united politically, and arranged marriages were often used to solidify temporary alliances.
1143	5337	Temüjin grew up observing the tough political climate of Mongolia, which included tribal warfare, thievery, raids, corruption, and continual acts of revenge carried out between the various confederations, all compounded by interference from foreign forces such as the Chinese dynasties to the south.
1143	5338	Temüjin's mother Hoelun taught him many lessons about the unstable political climate of Mongolia, especially the need for alliances.
1144	5339	As previously arranged by his father, Temüjin married Börte of the Onggirat tribe when he was around 16 in order to cement alliances between their respective tribes.
1144	5340	Soon after Börte's marriage to Temüjin, she was kidnapped by the Merkits and reportedly given away as a wife.
1144	5341	Temüjin rescued her with the help of his friend and future rival, Jamukha, and his protector, Toghrul Khan of the Keraite tribe.
1144	5342	She gave birth to a son, Jochi (1185–1226), nine months later, clouding the issue of his parentage.
1144	5343	Despite speculation over Jochi, Börte would be Temüjin's only empress, though he did follow tradition by taking several morganatic wives.
1145	5344	Börte had three more sons, Chagatai (1187—1241), Ögedei (1189—1241), and Tolui (1190–1232).
1145	5345	Genghis Khan also had many other children with his other wives, but they were excluded from the succession.
1145	5346	While the names of sons were documented, daughters were not.
1145	5347	The names of at least six daughters are known, and while they played significant roles behind the scenes during his lifetime, no documents have survived that definitively provide the number or names of daughters born to the consorts of Genghis Khan.
1146	5348	Temüjin began his ascent to power by offering himself as an ally (or, according to other sources, a vassal) to his father's anda (sworn brother or blood brother) Toghrul, who was Khan of the Keraites, and is better known by the Chinese title "Wang Khan", which the Jurchen Jin dynasty granted him in 1197.
1146	5349	This relationship was first reinforced when Börte was captured by the Merkits.
1146	5350	Temüjin turned to Toghrul for support, and in response, Toghrul offered his vassal 20,000 of his Keraite warriors and suggested that he also involve his childhood friend Jamukha, who had himself become Khan (ruler) of his own tribe, the Jadaran.
1147	5351	As Jamukha and Temüjin drifted apart in their friendship, each began consolidating power, and soon became rivals.
1147	5352	Jamukha supported the traditional Mongolian aristocracy, while Temüjin followed a meritocratic method, and attracted a broader, though lower class, range of followers.
1147	5353	Due to his earlier defeat of the Merkits, and a proclamation by the shaman Kokochu that the Eternal Blue Sky had set aside the world for Temüjin, Temüjin began rising to power.
1147	5354	In 1186, Temüjin was elected khan of the Mongols.
1147	5355	However, Jamukha, threatened by Temüjin's rapid ascent, quickly moved to stop Temüjin's ambitions.
1147	5356	In 1187, he launched an attack against his former friend with an army of thirty thousand troops.
1147	5357	Temüjin hastily gathered together his followers to defend against the attack, but he was decisively beaten in the Battle of Dalan Balzhut.
1147	5358	Jamukha horrified people greatly and harmed his image by boiling seventy young male captives alive in cauldrons, alienating many of his potential followers and eliciting sympathy for Temüjin.
1147	5359	Toghrul, as Temüjin's patron, was exiled to the Qara Khitai.
1147	5360	The life of Temüjin for the next ten years is very unclear, as historical records are mostly silent on that period.
1148	5361	As an incentive for absolute obedience and following his rule of law, the Yassa code, Temüjin promised civilians and soldiers wealth from future possible war spoils.
1148	5362	As he defeated rival tribes, he did not drive away enemy soldiers and abandon the rest.
1148	5363	Instead, he took the conquered tribe under his protection and integrated its members into his own tribe.
1148	5364	He would even have his mother adopt orphans from the conquered tribe, bringing them into his family.
1148	5365	These political innovations inspired great loyalty among the conquered people, making Temüjin stronger with each victory.
1149	5366	One of the later ruptures between Toghrul and Temüjin was Toghrul's refusal to give his daughter in marriage to Jochi, the eldest son of Temüjin, a sign of disrespect in the Mongolian culture.
1149	5367	This act led to the split between both factions and was a prelude to war.
1149	5368	Toghrul allied himself with Jamukha, who already opposed Temüjin's forces; however, the internal dispute between Toghrul and Jamukha, plus the desertion of a number of their allies to Temüjin, led to Toghrul's defeat.
1149	5369	This defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the Keraite tribe.
1150	5370	The next direct threat to Temüjin was the Naimans (Naiman Mongols), with whom Jamukha and his followers took refuge.
1150	5371	The Naimans did not surrender, although enough sectors again voluntarily sided with Temüjin.
1150	5372	In 1201, a khuruldai elected Jamukha as Gür Khan, "universal ruler", a title used by the rulers of the Qara Khitai.
1150	5373	Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach with Temüjin, and Jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him.
1150	5374	Before the conflict, however, several generals abandoned Jamukha, including Subutai, Jelme's well-known younger brother.
1150	5375	After several battles, Jamukha was finally turned over to Temüjin by his own men in 1206.
1151	5376	According to the Secret History, Temüjin again offered his friendship to Jamukha, asking him to return to his side.
1151	5377	Temüjin had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army.
1151	5378	Jamukha refused the offer of friendship and reunion, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death.
1151	5379	The custom is to die without spilling blood, which is granted by breaking the back.
1151	5380	Jamukha requested this form of death, despite the fact that in the past Jamukha had been known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive.
1152	5381	Accounts of Genghis Khan's life are marked by claims of a series of betrayals and conspiracies.
1152	5382	These include rifts with his early allies such as Jamukha (who also wanted to be a ruler of Mongol tribes) and Wang Khan (his and his father's ally), his son Jochi, and problems with the most important shaman, who was allegedly trying to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother Khasar.
1152	5383	His military strategies showed a deep interest in gathering good intelligence and understanding the motivations of his rivals, exemplified by his extensive spy network and Yam route systems.
1152	5384	He seemed to be a quick student, adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as siege warfare from the Chinese.
1152	5385	He was also ruthless, demonstrated by his tactic of measuring against the linchpin, used against the tribes led by Jamukha.
1153	5386	As a result, by 1206 Temüjin had managed to unite or subdue the Merkits, Naimans, Mongols, Keraites, Tatars, Uyghurs, and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule.
1153	5387	It was a monumental feat for the "Mongols" (as they became known collectively).
1153	5388	At a Khuruldai, a council of Mongol chiefs, Temüjin was acknowledged as "Khan" of the consolidated tribes and took the new title "Genghis Khan".
1153	5389	The title Khagan was not conferred on Genghis until after his death, when his son and successor, Ögedei, took the title for himself and extended it posthumously to his father (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the Yuan dynasty).
1153	5390	This unification of all confederations by Genghis Khan established peace between previously warring tribes and a single political and military force under Genghis Khan.
1154	5391	In 1211, after the conquest of Western Xia, Genghis Khan planned again to conquer the Jin dynasty.
1154	5392	The commander of the Jin dynasty army made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity.
1154	5393	Instead, the Jin commander sent a messenger, Ming-Tan, to the Mongol side, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass.
1154	5394	At this engagement fought at Badger Pass the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of Jin troops.
1154	5395	In 1215 Genghis besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day Beijing).
1154	5396	This forced the Emperor Xuanzong to move his capital south to Kaifeng, abandoning the northern half of his kingdom to the Mongols.
1154	5397	Between 1232 and 1233, Kaifeng fell to the Mongols under the reign of Genghis' third son, Ögedei Khan.
1154	5398	The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234, after the siege of Caizhou.
1155	5399	Kuchlug, the deposed Khan of the Naiman confederation that Temüjin defeated and folded into his Mongol Empire, fled west and usurped the khanate of Qara Khitai (also known as the Western Liao, as it was originally established as remnants of the Liao dynasty).
1155	5400	Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power.
1155	5401	By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty.
1155	5402	Therefore, Genghis sent only two tumen (20,000 soldiers) against Kuchlug, under his younger general, Jebe, known as "The Arrow".
1156	5403	With such a small force, the invading Mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, leaving the Qara Khitai more vulnerable to Mongol conquest.
1156	5404	As a result, Kuchlug's army was defeated west of Kashgar.
1156	5405	Kuchlug fled again, but was soon hunted down by Jebe's army and executed.
1156	5406	By 1218, as a result of defeat of Qara Khitai, the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as Lake Balkhash, which bordered the Khwarezmia (Khwarezmid Empire), a Muslim state that reached the Caspian Sea to the west and Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea to the south.
1157	5407	In the early 13th century, the Khwarazmian dynasty was governed by Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad.
1157	5408	Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarezmia as a commercial trading partner using the Silk Road, and he initially sent a 500-man caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire.
1157	5409	However, Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, attacked the caravan that came from Mongolia, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarezmia.
1157	5410	The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and handing over the perpetrators.
1157	5411	Genghis Khan then sent again a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself instead of the governor Inalchuq.
1157	5412	The Shah had all the men shaved and the Muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors.
1157	5413	This was seen as an affront and insult to Genghis Khan.
1157	5414	Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 tumens), his most capable generals and some of his sons.
1157	5415	He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed Ögedei to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarezmia.
1158	5416	The Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the Tien Shan mountains by entering the area controlled by the Khwarezmian Empire.
1158	5417	After compiling intelligence from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was divided into three groups.
1158	5418	His son Jochi led the first division into the northeast of Khwarezmia.
1158	5419	The second division under Jebe marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarzemia to form, with the first division, a pincer attack on Samarkand.
1158	5420	The third division under Genghis Khan and Tolui marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarzemia from that direction.
1159	5421	The Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities.
1159	5422	This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarezmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarzemi forces instead of facing a unified defense.
1159	5423	The Mongol army quickly seized the town of Otrar, relying on superior strategy and tactics.
1159	5424	Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions.
1159	5425	Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender.
1159	5426	Genghis Khan ordered Subutai and Jebe to hunt him down, giving them 20,000 men and two years to do this.
1159	5427	The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.
1160	5428	The Mongols' conquest, even by their own standards, was brutal.
1160	5429	After the capital Samarkand fell, the capital was moved to Bukhara by the remaining men, while Genghis Khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the Khwarezmid Empire, including not only royal buildings, but entire towns, populations, and even vast swaths of farmland.
1160	5430	According to legend, Genghis Khan even went so far as to divert a river through the Khwarezmid emperor's birthplace, erasing it from the map.
1161	5431	The Mongols attacked Samarkand using captured enemies as body shields.
1161	5432	After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the Shah, held out in the citadel.
1161	5433	After the fortress fell, Genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at Samarkand.
1161	5434	The people of Samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory.
1161	5435	Ata-Malik Juvayni, a high official in the service of the Mongol empire, wrote that in Termez, on the Oxus, "all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain".
1162	5436	The city of Bukhara was not heavily fortified, with a moat and a single wall, and the citadel typical of Khwarezmi cities.
1162	5437	The city leaders opened the gates to the Mongols, though a unit of Turkish defenders held the city's citadel for another twelve days.
1162	5438	Survivors from the citadel were executed, artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the Mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery.
1162	5439	As the Mongol soldiers looted the city, a fire broke out, razing most of the city to the ground.
1162	5440	Genghis Khan had the city's surviving population assemble in the main mosque of the town, where he declared that he was the flail of God, sent to punish them for their sins.
1163	5441	After the defeat of the Khwarezmian Empire in 1220, Genghis Khan gathered his forces in Persia and Armenia to return to the Mongolian steppes.
1163	5442	Under the suggestion of Subutai, the Mongol army was split into two forces.
1163	5443	Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two tumen) contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai.
1163	5444	They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan.
1163	5445	The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea.
1163	5446	Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area.
1163	5447	Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed.
1163	5448	At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force.
1163	5449	They also may have fought against the neighboring Volga Bulgars.
1163	5450	There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir, writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event.
1163	5451	Various historical secondary sources - Morgan, Chambers, Grousset - state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.
1163	5452	The Russian princes then sued for peace.
1163	5453	Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes.
1163	5454	As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death.
1163	5455	Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals.
1163	5456	Six Russian princes, including Mstislav III of Kiev, were put under this platform and crushed to death.
1164	5457	The Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for conquest of Hungary and Europe.
1164	5458	Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand.
1164	5459	The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe.
1164	5460	These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions.
1164	5461	In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia.
1164	5462	These invasions added Transoxiana and Persia to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way.
1164	5463	Later under Genghis Khan's grandson Batu and the Golden Horde, the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.
1165	5464	In 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts.
1165	5465	His armies quickly took Heisui, Ganzhou, and Suzhou (not the Suzhou in Jiangsu province), and in the autumn he took Xiliang-fu[disambiguation needed].
1165	5466	One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near Helan Mountains but was defeated.
1165	5467	In November, Genghis laid siege to the Tangut city Lingzhou and crossed the Yellow River, defeating the Tangut relief army.
1165	5468	According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.
1166	5469	In 1227, Genghis Khan's army attacked and destroyed the Tangut capital of Ning Hia and continued to advance, seizing Lintiao-fu, Xining province, Xindu-fu, and Deshun province in quick succession in the spring.
1166	5470	At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate.
1166	5471	Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle.
1166	5472	Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to Liupanshan (Qingshui County, Gansu Province) to escape the severe summer.
1166	5473	The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after.
1166	5474	Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut lineage.
1167	5475	The succession of Genghis Khan was already a significant topic during the later years of his reign, as he reached old age.
1167	5476	The long running paternity discussion about Genghis' oldest son Jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of Jochi among the brothers.
1167	5477	According to traditional historical accounts, the issue over Jochi's paternity was voiced most strongly by Chagatai.
1167	5478	In The Secret History of the Mongols, just before the invasion of the Khwarezmid Empire by Genghis Khan, Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor.
1167	5479	In response to this tension, and possibly for other reasons, Ögedei was appointed as successor.
1168	5480	Genghis Khan was aware of the friction between his sons (particularly between Chagatai and Jochi) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died.
1168	5481	He therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right, while appointing one of his sons as his successor.
1168	5482	Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior, because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his father's successor.
1168	5483	Tolui, Genghis Khan's youngest son, was not to be his successor because he was the youngest and in the Mongol culture, youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age.
1168	5484	If Jochi were to become successor, it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire.
1168	5485	Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to Ögedei.
1168	5486	Ögedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate and might defuse the situation between his brothers.
1169	5487	Jochi died in 1226, during his father's lifetime.
1169	5488	Some scholars, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan.
1169	5489	Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in Khorasan.
1169	5490	Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of Urgench.
1169	5491	Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief.
1169	5492	He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: "Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands.
1169	5493	I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims."
1169	5494	Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.
1170	5495	In August 1227, during the fall of Yinchuan, the capital of Western Xia, Genghis Khan died.
1170	5496	The exact cause of his death remains a mystery, and is variously attributed to being killed in action against the Western Xia, illness, falling from his horse, or wounds sustained in hunting or battle.
1170	5497	According to The Secret History of the Mongols Genghis Khan fell from his horse while hunting and died because of the injury.
1170	5498	He was already old and tired from his journeys.
1170	5499	The Galician–Volhynian Chronicle alleges he was killed by the Western Xia in battle, while Marco Polo wrote that he died after the infection of an arrow wound he received during his final campaign.
1170	5500	Later Mongol chronicles connect Genghis' death with a Western Xia princess taken as war booty.
1170	5501	One chronicle from the early 17th century even relates the legend that the princess hid a small dagger and stabbed him, though some Mongol authors have doubted this version and suspected it to be an invention by the rival Oirads.
1171	5502	Years before his death, Genghis Khan asked to be buried without markings, according to the customs of his tribe.
1171	5503	After he died, his body was returned to Mongolia and presumably to his birthplace in Khentii Aimag, where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the Onon River and the Burkhan Khaldun mountain (part of the Kentii mountain range).
1171	5504	According to legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried.
1171	5505	The Genghis Khan Mausoleum, constructed many years after his death, is his memorial, but not his burial site.
1172	5506	In 1939 Chinese Nationalist soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the 'Lord's Enclosure' (Mongolian: Edsen Khoroo) in Mongolia to protect it from Japanese troops.
1172	5507	It was taken through Communist-held territory in Yan'an some 900 km on carts to safety at a Buddhist monastery, the Dongshan Dafo Dian, where it remained for ten years.
1172	5508	In 1949, as Communist troops advanced, the Nationalist soldiers moved it another 200 km farther west to the famous Tibetan monastery of Kumbum Monastery or Ta'er Shi near Xining, which soon fell under Communist control.
1172	5509	In early 1954, Genghis Khan's bier and relics were returned to the Lord's Enclosure in Mongolia.
1172	5510	By 1956 a new temple was erected there to house them.
1172	5511	In 1968 during the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards destroyed almost everything of value.
1172	5512	The "relics" were remade in the 1970s and a great marble statue of Genghis was completed in 1989.
1173	5513	On October 6, 2004, a joint Japanese-Mongolian archaeological dig uncovered what is believed to be Genghis Khan's palace in rural Mongolia, which raises the possibility of actually locating the ruler's long-lost burial site.
1173	5514	Folklore says that a river was diverted over his grave to make it impossible to find (the same manner of burial as the Sumerian King Gilgamesh of Uruk and Atilla the Hun).
1173	5515	Other tales state that his grave was stampeded over by many horses, and that trees were then planted over the site, and the permafrost also did its part in hiding the burial site.
1174	5516	The Mongol Empire was governed by a civilian and military code, called the Yassa, created by Genghis Khan.
1174	5517	The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of ethnicity and race in the administrative realm, instead adopting an approach grounded in meritocracy.
1174	5518	The exception was the role of Genghis Khan and his family.
1174	5519	The Mongol Empire was one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse empires in history, as befitted its size.
1174	5520	Many of the empire's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves Mongols in military and civilian life, including Mongols, Turks and others and included many diverse Khans of various ethnicities as part of the Mongol Empire such as Muhammad Khan.
1175	5521	There were tax exemptions for religious figures and, to some extent, teachers and doctors.
1175	5522	The Mongol Empire practiced religious tolerance because Mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept, and not subject to law or interference.
1175	5523	[citation needed] Sometime before the rise of Genghis Khan, Ong Khan, his mentor and eventual rival, had converted to Nestorian Christianity.
1175	5524	Various Mongol tribes were Shamanist, Buddhist or Christian.
1175	5525	Religious tolerance was thus a well established concept on the Asian steppe.
1176	5526	Modern Mongolian historians say that towards the end of his life, Genghis Khan attempted to create a civil state under the Great Yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals, including women.
1176	5527	However, there is no evidence of this, or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the Chinese.
1176	5528	Women played a relatively important role in Mongol Empire and in family, for example Töregene Khatun was briefly in charge of the Mongol Empire when next male Khagan was being chosen.
1176	5529	Modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the Pax Mongolica (Mongol Peace).
1177	5530	Genghis Khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him.
1177	5531	He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities.
1177	5532	For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a Khitan prince, Chu'Tsai, who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated.
1177	5533	Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan.
1177	5534	Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers.
1177	5535	Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply.
1177	5536	Chu'Tsai administered parts of the Mongol Empire and became a confidant of the successive Mongol Khans.
1178	5537	Genghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as Muqali, Jebe and Subutai, and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members.
1178	5538	He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital Karakorum.
1178	5539	Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and Subutai and Jebe were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and Kievan Rus', an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative.
1178	5540	While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.
1179	5541	The Mongol military was also successful in siege warfare, cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities.
1179	5542	Another standard tactic of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced feigned retreat to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for ambush and counterattack.
1180	5543	Contrary to popular belief, Genghis Khan did not conquer all the areas ultimately part of the Mongol Empire.
1180	5544	At the time of his death, the Mongol Empire stretched from the Caspian Sea to the Sea of Japan.
1180	5545	The empire's expansion continued for a generation or more after Genghis's death in 1227.
1180	5546	Under Genghis's successor Ögedei Khan the speed of expansion reached its peak.
1180	5547	Mongol armies pushed into Persia, finished off the Western Xia and the remnants of the Khwarezmids, and came into conflict with the imperial Song dynasty of China, starting a war that lasted until 1279 and that concluded with the Mongols gaining control of all of China.
1180	5548	They also pushed further into Russia and eastern Europe.
1181	5549	Genghis Khan is credited with bringing the Silk Road under one cohesive political environment.
1181	5550	This allowed increased communication and trade between the West, Middle East and Asia, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas.
1181	5551	Some historians have noted that Genghis Khan instituted certain levels of meritocracy in his rule, was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers.
1181	5552	In Turkey, Genghis Khan is looked on as a great military leader, and it is popular for male children to carry his title as name.
1182	5553	In the early 1990s the memory of Genghis Khan with the Mongolian national identity has had a powerful revival partly because of his perception during the Mongolian People's Republic period.
1182	5554	Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity.
1182	5555	He is looked upon positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes.
1182	5556	For example, it is not uncommon for Mongolians to refer to their country as "Genghis Khan's Mongolia", to themselves as "Genghis Khan's children", and to Genghis Khan as the "father of the Mongols" especially among the younger generation.
1182	5557	However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality.
1182	5558	Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated.
1183	5559	In Mongolia today, Genghis Khan's name and likeness are endorsed on products, streets, buildings, and other places.
1183	5560	His face can be found on everyday commodities, from liquor bottles to candy products, and on the largest denominations of 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 Mongolian tögrög (₮).
1183	5561	Mongolia's main international airport in Ulaanbaatar is named Chinggis Khaan International Airport.
1183	5562	Major Genghis Khan statues have been erected before the parliament and near Ulaanbaatar.
1183	5563	There have been repeated discussions about regulating the use of his name and image to avoid trivialization.
1184	5564	Genghis Khan is regarded as one of the prominent leaders in Mongolia's history.
1184	5565	He is responsible for the emergence of the Mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity.
1184	5566	He reinforced many Mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes.
1184	5567	He is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law.
1184	5568	"Ikh Zasag law adopted during Genghis Khan’s time in Mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily," Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted.
1184	5569	President Elbegdorj sees Genghis Khan as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth.
1184	5570	"Chinggis (Genghis Khan)...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people.
1184	5571	He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces," Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth.
1184	5572	In summary, Mongolians see him as the fundamental figure in the founding of the Mongol Empire and therefore the basis for Mongolia as a country.
1185	5573	There are conflicting views of Genghis Khan in the People's Republic of China with some viewing him positively in the Inner Mongolia region where there are a monument and buildings about him and where there is a considerable number of Mongols in the area with a population of around 5 million, almost twice the population of Mongolia.
1185	5574	While Genghis Khan never conquered all of China, his grandson Kublai Khan completed that conquest and established the Yuan dynasty that is often credited with re-uniting China.
1185	5575	There has been much artwork and literature praising Genghis as a great military leader and political genius.
1185	5576	The years of the Mongol-established Yuan dynasty left an indelible imprint on Chinese political and social structures for subsequent generations with literature during the Jin dynasty relatively fewer.
1185	5577	In general the legacy of Genghis Khan and his successors, who completed the conquest of China after 65 years of struggle, remains a mixed topic.
1186	5578	In the Middle East, and particularly in Iran, Genghis Khan is almost universally condemned as a destructive and genocidal warlord who caused enormous damage and destruction to the population of these areas.
1186	5579	Steven R. Ward wrote that "Overall, the Mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-fourths of the population of the Iranian Plateau, possibly 10 to 15 million people.
1186	5580	Some historians have estimated that Iran's population did not again reach its pre-Mongol levels until the mid-20th century."
1187	5581	The invasions of Baghdad, Samarkand, Urgench, Kiev, Vladimir among others caused mass murders, such as when portions of southern Khuzestan were completely destroyed.
1187	5582	His descendant Hulagu Khan destroyed much of Iran's northern part and sacked Baghdad although his forces were halted by the Mamluks of Egypt, but Hulagu's descendant Ghazan Khan would return to beat the Egyptian Mamluks right out of Levant, Palestine and even Gaza.
1187	5583	According to the works of the Persian historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, the Mongols killed more than 70,000 people in Merv and more than 190,000 in Nishapur.
1187	5584	In 1237 Batu Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan, launched an invasion into Kievan Rus'.
1187	5585	Over the course of three years, the Mongols destroyed and annihilated all of the major cities of Eastern Europe with the exceptions of Novgorod and Pskov.
1188	5586	Although the famous Mughal emperors were proud descendants of Genghis Khan and particularly Timur, they clearly distanced themselves from the Mongol atrocities committed against the Khwarizim Shahs, Turks, Persians, the citizens of Baghdad and Damascus, Nishapur, Bukhara and historical figures such as Attar of Nishapur and many other notable Muslims.
1188	5587	However, Mughal Emperors directly patronized the legacies of Genghis Khan and Timur; together their names were synonymous with the names of other distinguished personalities particularly among the Muslim populations of South Asia.
1189	5588	One theory suggests the name stems from a palatalised version of the Mongolian and Turkic word tenggis, meaning "ocean", "oceanic" or "wide-spreading".
1189	5589	(Lake Baikal and ocean were called tenggis by the Mongols.
1189	5590	However, it seems that if they had meant to call Genghis tenggis they could have said, and written, "Tenggis Khan", which they did not.)
1189	5591	Zhèng (Chinese: 正) meaning "right", "just", or "true", would have received the Mongolian adjectival modifier -s, creating "Jenggis", which in medieval romanization would be written "Genghis".
1189	5592	It is likely that the 13th century Mongolian pronunciation would have closely matched "Chinggis".
1190	5593	Genghis Khan, the title is spelled in variety of ways in different languages such as Mongolian Chinggis Khaan, English Chinghiz, Chinghis, and Chingiz, Chinese: 成吉思汗; pinyin: Chéngjísī Hán, Turkic: Cengiz Han, Çingiz Xan, Çingiz Han, Chingizxon, Çıñğız Xan, Chengez Khan, Chinggis Khan, Chinggis Xaan, Chingis Khan, Jenghis Khan, Chinggis Qan, Djingis Kahn, Russian: Чингисхан (Čingiskhan) or Чингиз-хан (Čingiz-khan), etc.
1190	5594	Temüjin is written in Chinese as simplified Chinese: 铁木真; traditional Chinese: 鐵木眞; pinyin: Tiěmùzhēn.
1191	5595	The word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th–17th centuries.
1191	5596	However, the original Greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison.
1191	5597	In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners, such as surgery and midwifery.
1191	5598	The pharma (as it was referred to) often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines.
1191	5599	Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent.
1191	5600	The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed.
1191	5601	The Greek word Pharmakeia (Greek: φαρμακεία) derives from pharmakon (φάρμακον), meaning "drug", "medicine" (or "poison").
1192	5602	Pharmacists are healthcare professionals with specialised education and training who perform various roles to ensure optimal health outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines.
1192	5603	Pharmacists may also be small-business proprietors, owning the pharmacy in which they practice.
1192	5604	Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug, and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail, they play an important role in optimisation of a drug treatment for an individual.
1193	5605	A Pharmacy Technician in the UK is considered a health care professional and often does not work under the direct supervision of a pharmacist (if employed in a hospital pharmacy) but instead is supervised and managed by other senior pharmacy technicians.
1193	5606	In the UK the role of a PhT has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research.
1193	5607	A pharmacy technician once qualified has to register as a professional on the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) register.
1193	5608	The GPhC is the governing body for pharmacy health care professionals and this is who regulates the practice of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians.
1194	5609	In Ancient Greece, Diocles of Carystus (4th century BC) was one of several men studying the medicinal properties of plants.
1194	5610	He wrote several treatises on the topic.
1194	5611	The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides is famous for writing a five volume book in his native Greek Περί ύλης ιατρικής in the 1st century AD.
1194	5612	The Latin translation De Materia Medica (Concerning medical substances) was used a basis for many medieval texts, and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the Islamic Golden Age.
1194	5613	The title coined the term materia medica.
1195	5614	In Japan, at the end of the Asuka period (538–710) and the early Nara period (710–794), the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected.
1195	5615	The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the Taihō Code (701) and re-stated in the Yōrō Code (718).
1195	5616	Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration (1868).
1195	5617	In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists—and even pharmacist assistants—were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists.
1195	5618	In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.
1196	5619	The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology.
1196	5620	Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds.
1196	5621	Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation.
1196	5622	His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used.
1196	5623	Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments.
1196	5624	Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist.
1196	5625	Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications.
1196	5626	He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine.
1196	5627	Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'.
1196	5628	Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris.
1196	5629	Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering.
1196	5630	Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid.
1196	5631	He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds.
1196	5632	He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.
1197	5633	In Europe there are old pharmacies still operating in Dubrovnik, Croatia, located inside the Franciscan monastery, opened in 1317; and in the Town Hall Square of Tallinn, Estonia, dating from at least 1422.
1197	5634	The oldest is claimed to have been set up in 1221 in the Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Italy, which now houses a perfume museum.
1197	5635	The medieval Esteve Pharmacy, located in Llívia, a Catalan enclave close to Puigcerdà, also now a museum, dates back to the 15th century, keeping albarellos from the 16th and 17th centuries, old prescription books and antique drugs.
1198	5636	In most countries, the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc., specified in legislation.
1198	5637	Where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications, there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained pharmacy technicians while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients.
1198	5638	Pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues.
1199	5639	Because of the complexity of medications including specific indications, effectiveness of treatment regimens, safety of medications (i.e., drug interactions) and patient compliance issues (in the hospital and at home) many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area.
1199	5640	Those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy.
1199	5641	For example, there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology/oncology, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, critical care, emergency medicine, toxicology, nuclear pharmacy, pain management, psychiatry, anti-coagulation clinics, herbal medicine, neurology/epilepsy management, pediatrics, neonatal pharmacists and more.
1200	5642	Hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital.
1200	5643	Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting.
1200	5644	Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine.
1200	5645	Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and other medications given intravenously.
1200	5646	This is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, quality assurance of products, and adequate facilities.
1200	5647	Several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding.
1200	5648	The high cost of medications and drug-related technology, combined with the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety, make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible.
1201	5649	Pharmacists provide direct patient care services that optimizes the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention.
1201	5650	Clinical pharmacists care for patients in all health care settings, but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics.
1201	5651	Clinical pharmacists often collaborate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care.
1201	5652	Clinical pharmacists are now an integral part of the interdisciplinary approach to patient care.
1201	5653	They often participate in patient care rounds drug product selection.
1202	5654	The clinical pharmacist's role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems, identifying goals of therapy, and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient.
1202	5655	The review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of the drug therapy (e.g., drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy) and its efficacy.
1202	5656	The pharmacist must also monitor for potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and assess patient drug allergies while designing and initiating a drug therapy plan.
1203	5657	In the U.S. federal health care system (including the VA, the Indian Health Service, and NIH) ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority.
1203	5658	In some states such North Carolina and New Mexico these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority.
1203	5659	In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification.
1203	5660	The official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials BCACP.
1204	5661	Consultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review (i.e.
1204	5662	"cognitive services") than on actual dispensing of drugs.
1204	5663	Consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings.
1204	5664	Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for several large pharmacy management companies (primarily Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare and PharMerica).
1204	5665	This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings.
1204	5666	Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services.
1205	5667	Since about the year 2000, a growing number of Internet pharmacies have been established worldwide.
1205	5668	Many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies, and in fact, many of them are actually operated by brick-and-mortar community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door.
1205	5669	The primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received.
1205	5670	Some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take.
1205	5671	Internet pharmacies (also known as online pharmacies) are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are homebound.
1206	5672	While most Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription, some Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription.
1206	5673	Many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the "inconvenience" of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe.
1206	5674	However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication.
1206	5675	There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.
1207	5676	Of particular concern with Internet pharmacies is the ease with which people, youth in particular, can obtain controlled substances (e.g., Vicodin, generically known as hydrocodone) via the Internet without a prescription issued by a doctor/practitioner who has an established doctor-patient relationship.
1207	5677	There are many instances where a practitioner issues a prescription, brokered by an Internet server, for a controlled substance to a "patient" s/he has never met.
1207	5678	[citation needed] In the United States, in order for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid, it must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor-patient relationship.
1207	5679	The filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid.
1207	5680	Often, individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient-doctor relationship.
1208	5681	In the United States, there has been a push to legalize importation of medications from Canada and other countries, in order to reduce consumer costs.
1208	5682	While in most cases importation of prescription medications violates Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and federal laws, enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers, rather than consumers.
1208	5683	There is no known case of any U.S. citizens buying Canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities.
1209	5684	Pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science.
1209	5685	Pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy, however, they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies.
1209	5686	As a practice area and specialist domain, pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals.
1209	5687	Pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development, deployment and optimization.
1210	5688	Specialty pharmacies supply high cost injectable, oral, infused, or inhaled medications that are used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.
1210	5689	Unlike a traditional community pharmacy where prescriptions for any common medication can be brought in and filled, specialty pharmacies carry novel medications that need to be properly stored, administered, carefully monitored, and clinically managed.
1210	5690	In addition to supplying these drugs, specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs.
1210	5691	It is currently the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly FDA approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs.
1211	5692	In most jurisdictions (such as the United States), pharmacists are regulated separately from physicians.
1211	5693	These jurisdictions also usually specify that only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public, and that pharmacists cannot form business partnerships with physicians or give them "kickback" payments.
1211	5694	However, the American Medical Association (AMA) Code of Ethics provides that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices as long as there is no patient exploitation and patients have the right to a written prescription that can be filled elsewhere.
1211	5695	7 to 10 percent of American physicians practices reportedly dispense drugs on their own.
1212	5696	In some rural areas in the United Kingdom, there are dispensing physicians who are allowed to both prescribe and dispense prescription-only medicines to their patients from within their practices.
1212	5697	The law requires that the GP practice be located in a designated rural area and that there is also a specified, minimum distance (currently 1.6 kilometres) between a patient's home and the nearest retail pharmacy.
1212	5698	This law also exists in Austria for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away, or where none is registered in the city.
1213	5699	The reason for the majority rule is the high risk of a conflict of interest and/or the avoidance of absolute powers.
1213	5700	Otherwise, the physician has a financial self-interest in "diagnosing" as many conditions as possible, and in exaggerating their seriousness, because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient.
1213	5701	Such self-interest directly conflicts with the patient's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have side-effects.
1213	5702	This system reflects much similarity to the checks and balances system of the U.S. and many other governments.
1214	5703	In the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system.
1214	5704	Rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills.
1214	5705	In particular, Medication Therapy Management (MTM) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients.
1214	5706	Such services include the thorough analysis of all medication (prescription, non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual.
1214	5707	The result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system.
1215	5708	This shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews.
1215	5709	In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario).
1215	5710	In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education.
1215	5711	They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews.
1215	5712	In Scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable.
1215	5713	In the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy.
1215	5714	Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.
1215	5715	D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation.
1215	5716	In addition, consultant pharmacists, who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of "senior care pharmacy."
1216	5717	The two symbols most commonly associated with pharmacy in English-speaking countries are the mortar and pestle and the ℞ (recipere) character, which is often written as "Rx" in typed text.
1216	5718	The show globe was also used until the early 20th century.
1216	5719	Pharmacy organizations often use other symbols, such as the Bowl of Hygieia which is often used in the Netherlands, conical measures, and caduceuses in their logos.
1216	5720	Other symbols are common in different countries: the green Greek cross in France, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and India, the increasingly rare Gaper in the Netherlands, and a red stylized letter A in Germany and Austria (from Apotheke, the German word for pharmacy, from the same Greek root as the English word 'apothecary').
1217	5721	The immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease.
1217	5722	To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue.
1217	5723	In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity.
1217	5724	In humans, the blood–brain barrier, blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain.
1218	5725	Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens.
1218	5726	Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system, in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections.
1218	5727	Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates.
1218	5728	These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system.
1218	5729	Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently.
1218	5730	Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen.
1218	5731	This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.
1219	5732	Disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer.
1219	5733	Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections.
1219	5734	In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication.
1219	5735	In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms.
1219	5736	Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus.
1219	5737	Immunology covers the study of all aspects of the immune system.
1220	5738	Immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system.
1220	5739	It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease.
1220	5740	The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC.
1220	5741	Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time.
1220	5742	In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom.
1220	5743	This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease.
1220	5744	Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory.
1220	5745	It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease.
1220	5746	Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed.
1221	5747	The immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity.
1221	5748	In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism.
1221	5749	If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response.
1221	5750	Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals.
1221	5751	If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response.
1221	5752	Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen.
1221	5753	This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.
1222	5754	Both innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules.
1222	5755	In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system.
1222	5756	Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules.
1222	5757	One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.
1223	5758	Microorganisms or toxins that successfully enter an organism encounter the cells and mechanisms of the innate immune system.
1223	5759	The innate response is usually triggered when microbes are identified by pattern recognition receptors, which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms, or when damaged, injured or stressed cells send out alarm signals, many of which (but not all) are recognized by the same receptors as those that recognize pathogens.
1223	5760	Innate immune defenses are non-specific, meaning these systems respond to pathogens in a generic way.
1223	5761	This system does not confer long-lasting immunity against a pathogen.
1223	5762	The innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms.
1224	5763	Several barriers protect organisms from infection, including mechanical, chemical, and biological barriers.
1224	5764	The waxy cuticle of many leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection.
1224	5765	However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs, intestines, and the genitourinary tract.
1224	5766	In the lungs, coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract.
1224	5767	The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.
1225	5768	Chemical barriers also protect against infection.
1225	5769	The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the β-defensins.
1225	5770	Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials.
1225	5771	Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens.
1225	5772	In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.
1226	5773	Within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and, in some cases, by changing the conditions in their environment, such as pH or available iron.
1226	5774	This reduces the probability that pathogens will reach sufficient numbers to cause illness.
1226	5775	However, since most antibiotics non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi, oral antibiotics can lead to an "overgrowth" of fungi and cause conditions such as a vaginal candidiasis (a yeast infection).
1226	5776	There is good evidence that re-introduction of probiotic flora, such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli normally found in unpasteurized yogurt, helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on bacterial gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, urinary tract infection and post-surgical infections.
1227	5777	Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection.
1227	5778	The symptoms of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue.
1227	5779	Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells.
1227	5780	Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes).
1227	5781	Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell.
1227	5782	Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released.
1227	5783	These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.
1228	5784	Phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles.
1228	5785	Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines.
1228	5786	Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome.
1228	5787	The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome.
1228	5788	Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism.
1228	5789	Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.
1229	5790	Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens.
1229	5791	Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes.
1229	5792	During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly as a result of bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection.
1229	5793	Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1.
1229	5794	Macrophages also act as scavengers, ridding the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.
1230	5795	Leukocytes (white blood cells) act like independent, single-celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system.
1230	5796	The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells.
1230	5797	These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms.
1230	5798	Innate cells are also important mediators in the activation of the adaptive immune system.
1231	5799	Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the external environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines.
1231	5800	They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system.
1231	5801	Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.
1232	5802	Natural killer cells, or NK cells, are a component of the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading microbes.
1232	5803	Rather, NK cells destroy compromised host cells, such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells, recognizing such cells by a condition known as "missing self."
1232	5804	This term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called MHC I (major histocompatibility complex) – a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells.
1232	5805	They were named "natural killer" because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are "missing self."
1232	5806	For many years it was unclear how NK cells recognize tumor cells and infected cells.
1232	5807	It is now known that the MHC makeup on the surface of those cells is altered and the NK cells become activated through recognition of "missing self".
1232	5808	Normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by NK cells because they express intact self MHC antigens.
1232	5809	Those MHC antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) which essentially put the brakes on NK cells.
1233	5810	The adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory, where each pathogen is "remembered" by a signature antigen.
1233	5811	The adaptive immune response is antigen-specific and requires the recognition of specific "non-self" antigens during a process called antigen presentation.
1233	5812	Antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells.
1233	5813	The ability to mount these tailored responses is maintained in the body by "memory cells".
1233	5814	Should a pathogen infect the body more than once, these specific memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it.
1234	5815	Both B cells and T cells carry receptor molecules that recognize specific targets.
1234	5816	T cells recognize a "non-self" target, such as a pathogen, only after antigens (small fragments of the pathogen) have been processed and presented in combination with a "self" receptor called a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule.
1234	5817	There are two major subtypes of T cells: the killer T cell and the helper T cell.
1234	5818	In addition there are regulatory T cells which have a role in modulating immune response.
1234	5819	Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules, while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class II MHC molecules.
1234	5820	These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell.
1234	5821	A third, minor subtype are the γδ T cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors.
1235	5822	Killer T cells are a sub-group of T cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses (and other pathogens), or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional.
1235	5823	As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen.
1235	5824	Killer T cells are activated when their T cell receptor (TCR) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell.
1235	5825	Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called CD8.
1235	5826	The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen.
1235	5827	When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter.
1235	5828	The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis.
1235	5829	T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses.
1235	5830	T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by "helper" T cells (see below).
1236	5831	Helper T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules.
1236	5832	The MHC:antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) that are responsible for the T cell's activation.
1236	5833	Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule.
1236	5834	Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell.
1236	5835	The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types.
1236	5836	Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells.
1236	5837	In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.
1237	5838	Gamma delta T cells (γδ T cells) possess an alternative T cell receptor (TCR) as opposed to CD4+ and CD8+ (αβ) T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells.
1237	5839	The conditions that produce responses from γδ T cells are not fully understood.
1237	5840	Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, γδ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity.
1237	5841	On one hand, γδ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype.
1237	5842	On the other hand, the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors.
1237	5843	For example, large numbers of human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted Vδ1+ T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells.
1238	5844	A B cell identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen.
1238	5845	This antigen/antibody complex is taken up by the B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides.
1238	5846	The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides on its surface MHC class II molecules.
1238	5847	This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell.
1238	5848	As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen.
1238	5849	These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes.
1238	5850	Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.
1239	5851	When B cells and T cells are activated and begin to replicate, some of their offspring become long-lived memory cells.
1239	5852	Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again.
1239	5853	This is "adaptive" because it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges.
1239	5854	Immunological memory can be in the form of either passive short-term memory or active long-term memory.
1240	5855	Newborn infants have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection.
1240	5856	Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother.
1240	5857	During pregnancy, a particular type of antibody, called IgG, is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta, so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother.
1240	5858	Breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies.
1240	5859	This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies—it only borrows them.
1240	5860	This passive immunity is usually short-term, lasting from a few days up to several months.
1240	5861	In medicine, protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody-rich serum.
1241	5862	Hormones can act as immunomodulators, altering the sensitivity of the immune system.
1241	5863	For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses.
1241	5864	Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty.
1241	5865	By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive.
1241	5866	Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.
1242	5867	When suffering from sleep deprivation, active immunizations may have a diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production, and a lower immune response, than would be noted in a well-rested individual.
1242	5868	Additionally, proteins such as NFIL3, which have been shown to be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation, shift work, etc.
1242	5869	As a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.
1243	5870	It is conjectured that a progressive decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals.
1243	5871	Conversely, some hormones are regulated by the immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity.
1243	5872	The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly.
1243	5873	As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels.
1243	5874	First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels.
1243	5875	This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation.
1243	5876	Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.
1244	5877	The main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells.
1244	5878	Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens.
1244	5879	This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal.
1244	5880	NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way, especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors.
1244	5881	Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system.
1245	5882	Unlike animals, plants lack phagocytic cells, but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant.
1245	5883	Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs.
1245	5884	When a part of a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant.
1245	5885	Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent.
1245	5886	RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication.
1246	5887	Overactive immune responses comprise the other end of immune dysfunction, particularly the autoimmune disorders.
1246	5888	Here, the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and non-self, and attacks part of the body.
1246	5889	Under normal circumstances, many T cells and antibodies react with "self" peptides.
1246	5890	One of the functions of specialized cells (located in the thymus and bone marrow) is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced throughout the body and to eliminate those cells that recognize self-antigens, preventing autoimmunity.
1247	5891	Immunodeficiencies occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive.
1247	5892	The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence.
1247	5893	In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function.
1247	5894	However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries.
1247	5895	Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production.
1247	5896	Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.
1248	5897	Long-term active memory is acquired following infection by activation of B and T cells.
1248	5898	Active immunity can also be generated artificially, through vaccination.
1248	5899	The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism.
1248	5900	This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility.
1248	5901	With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.
1249	5902	The success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses.
1249	5903	Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system.
1249	5904	Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system.
1249	5905	Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host.
1249	5906	These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.
1250	5907	In the mid-1950s, Frank Burnet, inspired by a suggestion made by Niels Jerne, formulated the clonal selection theory (CST) of immunity.
1250	5908	On the basis of CST, Burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction: "self" constituents (constituents of the body) do not trigger destructive immune responses, while "nonself" entities (pathogens, an allograft) trigger a destructive immune response.
1250	5909	The theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex "two-signal" activation of T cells.
1250	5910	The self/nonself theory of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been criticized, but remain very influential.
1251	5911	Anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to control the effects of inflammation.
1251	5912	Glucocorticoids are the most powerful of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled.
1251	5913	Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.
1251	5914	Cytotoxic drugs inhibit the immune response by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells.
1251	5915	However, the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected, which causes toxic side effects.
1251	5916	Immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin prevent T cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways.
1252	5917	In contrast, during wake periods differentiated effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens.
1252	5918	As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak.
1252	5919	There are two theories as to why the pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time.
1252	5920	First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times.
1252	5921	Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin.
1252	5922	Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.
1253	5923	When a T-cell encounters a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor.
1253	5924	This is essentially a signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin D, the steroid hormone calcitriol.
1253	5925	T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D. Not only does the T-cell extend a vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin D, calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol.
1253	5926	Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function.
1253	5927	Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.
1254	5928	Pattern recognition receptors are proteins used by nearly all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens.
1254	5929	Antimicrobial peptides called defensins are an evolutionarily conserved component of the innate immune response found in all animals and plants, and represent the main form of invertebrate systemic immunity.
1254	5930	The complement system and phagocytic cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life.
1254	5931	Ribonucleases and the RNA interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes, and are thought to play a role in the immune response to viruses.
1255	5932	Evolution of the adaptive immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates.
1255	5933	Many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates.
1255	5934	However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the lamprey and hagfish.
1255	5935	These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from only a small number (one or two) of genes.
1255	5936	These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.
1256	5937	It is likely that a multicomponent, adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response.
1256	5938	Many species, however, utilize mechanisms that appear to be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity.
1256	5939	Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism, called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages.
1256	5940	Prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity, through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference.
1256	5941	Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes, but studies of their roles in defense are few.
1257	5942	Immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude.
1257	5943	Many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time.
1257	5944	The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between "cellular" and "humoral" theories of immunity.
1257	5945	According to the cellular theory of immunity, represented in particular by Elie Metchnikoff, it was cells – more precisely, phagocytes – that were responsible for immune responses.
1257	5946	In contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held, among others, by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring, stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism’s “humors” rather than its cells.
1258	5947	Clearly, some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers.
1258	5948	Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I molecules on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells.
1258	5949	Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes.
1258	5950	In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so the immune system no longer attacks the tumor cells.
1259	5951	Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues.
1259	5952	They are divided into four classes (Type I – IV) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction.
1259	5953	Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy.
1259	5954	Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death.
1259	5955	Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen.
1259	5956	Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction.
1259	5957	This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies.
1259	5958	Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions.
1259	5959	Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop.
1259	5960	Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy).
1259	5961	These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.
1260	5962	An evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis).
1260	5963	Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement.
1260	5964	Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.).
1260	5965	Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement.
1260	5966	Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response.
1260	5967	Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system.
1260	5968	Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis.
1260	5969	Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).
1261	5970	The mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated.
1261	5971	The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential epitopes (amino acids and/or sugars) on the surface of the pathogen, while keeping essential epitopes concealed.
1261	5972	An example is HIV, which mutates rapidly, so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing.
1261	5973	These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus.
1261	5974	The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy, constantly switching one type of surface protein for another, allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response.
1261	5975	Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system.
1261	5976	In HIV, the envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell; such "self-cloaked" viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as "non-self" structures.
1262	5977	Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate tumors.
1262	5978	The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells.
1262	5979	To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells.
1262	5980	The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells.
1262	5981	One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g.
1262	5982	A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.
1263	5983	Larger drugs (>500 Da) can provoke a neutralizing immune response, particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses.
1263	5984	This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are typically larger than 6000 Da).
1263	5985	In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for Taxol.
1263	5986	Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments.
1263	5987	Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set.
1263	5988	A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells.
1263	5989	The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics.
1263	5990	Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response.
1264	5991	In addition to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation, sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity.
1264	5992	First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin.
1264	5993	These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma.
1264	5994	These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation.
1264	5995	It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like naïve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e.
1264	5996	during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response).
1264	5997	In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and naïve T cell migration to lymph nodes.
1264	5998	This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.
1265	5999	In humans, this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes.
1265	6000	This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response.
1265	6001	The speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases.
1265	6002	After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on.
1265	6003	This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback.
1265	6004	The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction.
1265	6005	This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.
1266	6006	One of its earliest massive implementations was brought about by Egyptians against the British occupation in the 1919 Revolution.
1266	6007	Civil disobedience is one of the many ways people have rebelled against what they deem to be unfair laws.
1266	6008	It has been used in many nonviolent resistance movements in India (Gandhi's campaigns for independence from the British Empire), in Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution and in East Germany to oust their communist governments, In South Africa in the fight against apartheid, in the American Civil Rights Movement, in the Singing Revolution to bring independence to the Baltic countries from the Soviet Union, recently with the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia and the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, among other various movements worldwide.
1267	6009	One of the oldest depictions of civil disobedience is in Sophocles' play Antigone, in which Antigone, one of the daughters of former King of Thebes, Oedipus, defies Creon, the current King of Thebes, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial.
1267	6010	She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law.
1267	6011	She is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with (and eventually carries out), but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this.
1268	6012	Following the Peterloo massacre of 1819, poet Percy Shelley wrote the political poem The Mask of Anarchy later that year, that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time—and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action.
1268	6013	It is perhaps the first modern[vague] statement of the principle of nonviolent protest.
1268	6014	A version was taken up by the author Henry David Thoreau in his essay Civil Disobedience, and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of Satyagraha.
1268	6015	Gandhi's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action.
1268	6016	In particular, it is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's Masque of Anarchy to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.
1269	6017	It has been argued that the term "civil disobedience" has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times, become utterly debased.
1269	6018	Marshall Cohen notes, "It has been used to describe everything from bringing a test-case in the federal courts to taking aim at a federal official.
1269	6019	Indeed, for Vice President Agnew it has become a code-word describing the activities of muggers, arsonists, draft evaders, campaign hecklers, campus militants, anti-war demonstrators, juvenile delinquents and political assassins."
1270	6020	LeGrande writes that "the formulation of a single all-encompassing definition of the term is extremely difficult, if not impossible.
1270	6021	In reviewing the voluminous literature on the subject, the student of civil disobedience rapidly finds himself surrounded by a maze of semantical problems and grammatical niceties.
1270	6022	Like Alice in Wonderland, he often finds that specific terminology has no more (or no less) meaning than the individual orator intends it to have."
1270	6023	He encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration, nonviolent civil disobedience, and violent civil disobedience.
1271	6024	Civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, as distinguished from a constitutional impasse in which two public agencies, especially two equally sovereign branches of government, conflict.
1271	6025	For instance, if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court, it would not be civil disobedience, since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen.
1272	6026	However, this definition is disputed by Thoreau's political philosophy pitching the conscience vs. the collective.
1272	6027	The individual is the final judge of right and wrong.
1272	6028	More than this, since only individuals act, only individuals can act unjustly.
1272	6029	When the government knocks on the door, it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood.
1272	6030	Before Thoreau’s imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, “Resign.” If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice.
1272	6031	But if government is “the voice of the people,” as it is often called, shouldn’t that voice be heeded?
1272	6032	Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians.
1272	6033	Even a good form of government is “liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.” Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said.
1272	6034	The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right.
1272	6035	What, then, is the proper relationship between the individual and the government?
1273	6036	Some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities.
1273	6037	Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions, banks, and private universities can be justified if it reflects "a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken".
1273	6038	The same principle, she argues, applies to breaches of law in protest against international organizations and foreign governments.
1274	6039	It is usually recognized that lawbreaking, if it is not done publicly, at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience.
1274	6040	But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality, we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking.
1274	6041	If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights, he might, for instance, find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience.
1274	6042	This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations.
1274	6043	The Fully Informed Jury Association's publication "A Primer for Prospective Jurors" notes, "Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitler's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house."
1274	6044	By this definition, civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus, where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it.
1275	6045	There have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent.
1275	6046	Black's Law Dictionary includes non-violence in its definition of civil disobedience.
1275	6047	Christian Bay's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires "carefully chosen and legitimate means," but holds that they do not have to be non-violent.
1275	6048	It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedients' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest.
1275	6049	Civil disobedients' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society's tolerance of civil disobedience.
1276	6050	Non-revolutionary civil disobedience is a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged "wrong" by an individual conscience, or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue.
1276	6051	Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government (or to change cultural traditions, social customs, religious beliefs, etc...revolution doesn't have to be political, i.e.
1276	6052	"cultural revolution", it simply implies sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric).
1276	6053	Gandhi's acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience.
1276	6054	It has been claimed that the Hungarians under Ferenc Deák directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the Austrian government.
1276	6055	Thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing "peaceable revolution."
1276	6056	Howard Zinn, Harvey Wheeler, and others have identified the right espoused in The Declaration of Independence to "alter or abolish" an unjust government to be a principle of civil disobedience.
1277	6057	The earliest recorded incidents of collective civil disobedience took place during the Roman Empire[citation needed].
1277	6058	Unarmed Jews gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images in the Temple in Jerusalem.
1277	6059	In modern times, some activists who commit civil disobedience as a group collectively refuse to sign bail until certain demands are met, such as favorable bail conditions, or the release of all the activists.
1277	6060	This is a form of jail solidarity.
1277	6061	[page needed] There have also been many instances of solitary civil disobedience, such as that committed by Thoreau, but these sometimes go unnoticed.
1277	6062	Thoreau, at the time of his arrest, was not yet a well-known author, and his arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days, weeks and months after it happened.
1277	6063	The tax collector who arrested him rose to higher political office, and Thoreau's essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War.
1278	6064	Civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts.
1278	6065	Bedau writes, "There is a whole class of acts, undertaken in the name of civil disobedience, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g.
1278	6066	trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation)...Such acts are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane...The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity."
1278	6067	Bedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose.
1278	6068	Some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the U.S. Government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law.
1278	6069	Julia Butterfly Hill lived in Luna, a 180-foot (55 m)-tall, 600-year-old California Redwood tree for 738 days, successfully preventing it from being cut down.
1279	6070	In cases where the criminalized behavior is pure speech, civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech.
1279	6071	An example would be WBAI's broadcasting the track "Filthy Words" from a George Carlin comedy album, which eventually led to the 1978 Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation.
1279	6072	Threatening government officials is another classic way of expressing defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies.
1279	6073	For example, Joseph Haas was arrested for allegedly sending an email to the Lebanon, New Hampshire city councilors stating, "Wise up or die."
1280	6074	Some forms of civil disobedience, such as illegal boycotts, refusals to pay taxes, draft dodging, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and sit-ins, make it more difficult for a system to function.
1280	6075	In this way, they might be considered coercive.
1280	6076	Brownlee notes that "although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue, nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion in order to get their issue onto the table."
1280	6077	The Plowshares organization temporarily closed GCSB Waihopai by padlocking the gates and using sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes.
1281	6078	Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases.
1281	6079	For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers.
1281	6080	It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful.
1281	6081	However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude.
1281	6082	Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers.
1281	6083	Thoreau wrote, "My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with--for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government.
1281	6084	How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action."
1282	6085	Some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract, which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established, or else suffer the penalties set out in the law.
1282	6086	Other civil disobedients who favor the existence of government still don't believe in the legitimacy of their particular government, or don't believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted.
1282	6087	And still other civil disobedients, being anarchists, don't believe in the legitimacy of any government, and therefore see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others.
1283	6088	An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty.
1283	6089	There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law.
1283	6090	It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience.
1283	6091	ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, "Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me.
1283	6092	I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it.
1283	6093	I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged," but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, "Guilt implies wrong-doing.
1283	6094	I feel I have done no wrong.
1283	6095	I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong.
1283	6096	A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two.
1283	6097	One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, "I plead for the beauty that surrounds us"; this is known as a "creative plea," and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty.
1284	6098	When the Committee for Non-Violent Action sponsored a protest in August 1957, at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada, 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest.
1284	6099	At a pre-arranged announced time, one at a time they stepped across the "line" and were immediately arrested.
1284	6100	They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah, Nevada, and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace, that afternoon.
1284	6101	A well known civil rights attorney, Francis Heisler, had volunteered to defend the arrested persons, advising them to plead "nolo contendere", as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not-guilty.
1284	6102	The arrested persons were found "guilty," nevertheless, and given suspended sentences, conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds.
1285	6103	Howard Zinn writes, "There may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice.
1285	6104	But that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience.
1285	6105	The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail, or by evading it.
1285	6106	To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest...In particular, the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated."
1286	6107	Sometimes the prosecution proposes a plea bargain to civil disobedients, as in the case of the Camden 28, in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanor count and receive no jail time.
1286	6108	In some mass arrest situations, the activists decide to use solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone.
1286	6109	But some activists have opted to enter a blind plea, pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place.
1286	6110	Mohandas Gandhi pleaded guilty and told the court, "I am here to .
1286	6111	submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen."
1287	6112	Some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech, or a speech explaining their actions, in allocution.
1287	6113	In U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar, a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on U.S. Navy property argued to the court in allocution that "the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy".
1287	6114	As a result, the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days.
1287	6115	This action was upheld because, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, her statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions.
1287	6116	Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials.
1288	6117	Steven Barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty, "they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine, or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience."
1288	6118	A technical defense may enhance the chances for acquittal but make for more boring proceedings and reduced press coverage.
1288	6119	During the Vietnam War era, the Chicago Eight used a political defense, while Benjamin Spock used a technical defense.
1288	6120	In countries such as the United States whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek jury nullification.
1288	6121	Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as Sparf v. United States, which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative, and United States v. Dougherty, which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification.
1289	6122	One theory is that, while disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit.
1289	6123	Therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished.
1289	6124	Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law, and then wins his case, then that act did not constitute civil disobedience.
1289	6125	It has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification, as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law, is not civil disobedience.
1289	6126	Likewise, a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution, or by denying having committed the crime, or by fleeing the jurisdiction, is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient.
1290	6127	Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: "Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law."
1290	6128	During the Vietnam War, courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War; the courts ruled it was a political question.
1290	6129	The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom.
1290	6130	However, court cases such as U.S. v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense.
1290	6131	Likewise, when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance's 1977 illegal occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense, and he was found guilty.
1290	6132	Fully Informed Jury Association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to; according to FIJA, many of them have escaped prosecution because "prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence."
1291	6133	Along with giving the offender his "just deserts", achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment.
1291	6134	Brownlee argues, "Bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law’s engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law."
1291	6135	Leonard Hubert Hoffmann writes, "In deciding whether or not to impose punishment, the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good.
1291	6136	This means that the objector has no right not to be punished.
1291	6137	It is a matter for the state (including the judges) to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not."
1292	6138	Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure.
1292	6139	Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client.
1292	6140	Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries.
1292	6141	Construction starts with planning,[citation needed] design, and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use.
1293	6142	Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines.
1293	6143	An architect normally manages the job, and a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project manager supervises it.
1293	6144	For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential.
1293	6145	Those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider zoning requirements, the environmental impact of the job, the successful scheduling, budgeting, construction-site safety, availability and transportation of building materials, logistics, inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding, etc.
1293	6146	The largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects.
1294	6147	In general, there are three sectors of construction: buildings, infrastructure and industrial.
1294	6148	Building construction is usually further divided into residential and non-residential (commercial/institutional).
1294	6149	Infrastructure is often called heavy/highway, heavy civil or heavy engineering.
1294	6150	It includes large public works, dams, bridges, highways, water/wastewater and utility distribution.
1294	6151	Industrial includes refineries, process chemical, power generation, mills and manufacturing plants.
1294	6152	There are other ways to break the industry into sectors or markets.
1295	6153	Engineering News-Record (ENR) is a trade magazine for the construction industry.
1295	6154	Each year, ENR compiles and reports on data about the size of design and construction companies.
1295	6155	They publish a list of the largest companies in the United States (Top-40) and also a list the largest global firms (Top-250, by amount of work they are doing outside their home country).
1295	6156	In 2014, ENR compiled the data in nine market segments.
1295	6157	It was divided as transportation, petroleum, buildings, power, industrial, water, manufacturing, sewer/waste, telecom, hazardous waste plus a tenth category for other projects.
1295	6158	In their reporting on the Top 400, they used data on transportation, sewer, hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors.
1296	6159	The Standard Industrial Classification and the newer North American Industry Classification System have a classification system for companies that perform or otherwise engage in construction.
1296	6160	To recognize the differences of companies in this sector, it is divided into three subsectors: building construction, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors.
1296	6161	There are also categories for construction service firms (e.g., engineering, architecture) and construction managers (firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project).
1297	6162	Building construction is the process of adding structure to real property or construction of buildings.
1297	6163	The majority of building construction jobs are small renovations, such as addition of a room, or renovation of a bathroom.
1297	6164	Often, the owner of the property acts as laborer, paymaster, and design team for the entire project.
1297	6165	Although building construction projects typically include various common elements, such as design, financial, estimating and legal considerations, many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results, such as structural collapse, cost overruns, and/or litigation.
1297	6166	For this reason, those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome.
1298	6167	Residential construction practices, technologies, and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice.
1298	6168	Materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used (e.g.
1298	6169	Cost of construction on a per square meter (or per square foot) basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site conditions, local regulations, economies of scale (custom designed homes are often more expensive to build) and the availability of skilled tradespeople.
1298	6170	As residential construction (as well as all other types of construction) can generate a lot of waste, careful planning again is needed here.
1299	6171	New techniques of building construction are being researched, made possible by advances in 3D printing technology.
1299	6172	In a form of additive building construction, similar to the additive manufacturing techniques for manufactured parts, building printing is making it possible to flexibly construct small commercial buildings and private habitations in around 20 hours, with built-in plumbing and electrical facilities, in one continuous build, using large 3D printers.
1299	6173	Working versions of 3D-printing building technology are already printing 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) of building material per hour as of January 2013[update], with the next-generation printers capable of 3.5 metres (11 ft) per hour, sufficient to complete a building in a week.
1299	6174	Dutch architect Janjaap Ruijssenaars's performative architecture 3D-printed building is scheduled to be built in 2014.
1300	6175	In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality.
1300	6176	A formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts.
1300	6177	The design usually consists of drawings and specifications, usually prepared by a design team including Architect, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, structural engineers, fire protection engineers, planning consultants, architectural consultants, and archaeological consultants.
1300	6178	The design team is most commonly employed by (i.e.
1300	6179	in contract with) the property owner.
1300	6180	Under this system, once the design is completed by the design team, a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work, either based directly on the design, or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor.
1300	6181	Following evaluation of bids, the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder.
1301	6182	The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties, especially among large firms.
1301	6183	In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies, even in the larger firms.
1301	6184	Presently, a firm that is nominally an "architecture" or "construction management" firm may have experts from all related fields as employees, or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill.
1301	6185	Thus, each such firm may offer itself as "one-stop shopping" for a construction project, from beginning to end.
1301	6186	This is designated as a "design build" contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction, while adhering to the performance specifications.
1302	6187	Several project structures can assist the owner in this integration, including design-build, partnering and construction management.
1302	6188	In general, each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects, interior designers, engineers and constructors throughout design and construction.
1302	6189	In response, many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design-build process.
1303	6190	Construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems.
1303	6191	Underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project.
1303	6192	Cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and materials, and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time, can arise even when the overall total is enough.
1303	6193	Fraud is a problem in many fields, but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field.
1303	6194	Financial planning for the project is intended to ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project.
1304	6195	Mortgage bankers, accountants, and cost engineers are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project.
1304	6196	The presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely, even in relatively small projects since the owner's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project.
1304	6197	Accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process.
1304	6198	Cost engineers and estimators apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation.
1304	6199	Cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs, which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid.
1305	6200	The project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements.
1305	6201	Constructing a project that fails to adhere to codes does not benefit the owner.
1305	6202	Some legal requirements come from malum in se considerations, or the desire to prevent things that are indisputably bad – bridge collapses or explosions.
1305	6203	Other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations, or things that are a matter of custom or expectation, such as isolating businesses to a business district and residences to a residential district.
1305	6204	An attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built, either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable (the bridge design will not cause a collapse), or that the custom is no longer needed (acceptance of live-work spaces has grown in the community).
1306	6205	A construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider.
1306	6206	A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible.
1306	6207	The time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive.
1306	6208	Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out.
1306	6209	Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.
1307	6210	There is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co-operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project.
1307	6211	New forms include partnering such as Public-Private Partnering (PPPs) aka private finance initiatives (PFIs) and alliances such as "pure" or "project" alliances and "impure" or "strategic" alliances.
1307	6212	The focus on co-operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry.
1308	6213	This is the most common method of construction procurement and is well established and recognized.
1308	6214	In this arrangement, the architect or engineer acts as the project coordinator.
1308	6215	His or her role is to design the works, prepare the specifications and produce construction drawings, administer the contract, tender the works, and manage the works from inception to completion.
1308	6216	There are direct contractual links between the architect's client and the main contractor.
1308	6217	Any subcontractor has a direct contractual relationship with the main contractor.
1308	6218	The procedure continues until the building is ready to occupy.
1309	6219	The owner produces a list of requirements for a project, giving an overall view of the project's goals.
1309	6220	Several D&B contractors present different ideas about how to accomplish these goals.
1309	6221	The owner selects the ideas he or she likes best and hires the appropriate contractor.
1309	6222	Often, it is not just one contractor, but a consortium of several contractors working together.
1309	6223	Once these have been hired, they begin building the first phase of the project.
1309	6224	As they build phase 1, they design phase 2.
1309	6225	This is in contrast to a design-bid-build contract, where the project is completely designed by the owner, then bid on, then completed.
1310	6226	Before the foundation can be dug, contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked, either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services.
1310	6227	This lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities, which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations.
1310	6228	During the construction of a building, the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code.
1310	6229	Once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed, an occupancy permit may be issued.
1311	6230	In the United States, the industry in 2014 has around $960 billion in annual revenue according to statistics tracked by the Census Bureau, of which $680 billion is private (split evenly between residential and nonresidential) and the remainder is government.
1311	6231	As of 2005, there were about 667,000 firms employing 1 million contractors (200,000 general contractors, 38,000 heavy, and 432,000 specialty); the average contractor employed fewer than 10 employees.
1311	6232	As a whole, the industry employed an estimated 5.8 million as of April 2013, with a 13.2% unemployment rate.
1311	6233	In the United States, approximately 828,000 women were employed in the construction industry as of 2011.
1312	6234	In 2010 a salary survey revealed the differences in remuneration between different roles, sectors and locations in the construction and built environment industry.
1312	6235	The results showed that areas of particularly strong growth in the construction industry, such as the Middle East, yield higher average salaries than in the UK for example.
1312	6236	The average earning for a professional in the construction industry in the Middle East, across all sectors, job types and levels of experience, is £42,090, compared to £26,719 in the UK.
1312	6237	This trend is not necessarily due to the fact that more affluent roles are available, however, as architects with 14 or more years experience working in the Middle East earn on average £43,389 per annum, compared to £40,000 in the UK.
1312	6238	Some construction workers in the US/Canada have made more than $100,000 annually, depending on their trade.
1313	6239	Construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world, incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the United States and in the European Union.
1313	6240	In 2009, the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for all workers.
1313	6241	Falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers.
1313	6242	Proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry.
1313	6243	Other major causes of fatalities in the construction industry include electrocution, transportation accidents, and trench cave-ins.
1314	6244	Private schools, also known as independent schools, non-governmental, or nonstate schools, are not administered by local, state or national governments; thus, they retain the right to select their students and are funded in whole or in part by charging their students tuition, rather than relying on mandatory taxation through public (government) funding; at some private schools students may be able to get a scholarship, which makes the cost cheaper, depending on a talent the student may have (e.g.
1314	6245	sport scholarship, art scholarship, academic scholarship), financial need, or tax credit scholarships that might be available.
1315	6246	In the United Kingdom and several other Commonwealth countries including Australia and Canada, the use of the term is generally restricted to primary and secondary educational levels; it is almost never used of universities and other tertiary institutions.
1315	6247	Private education in North America covers the whole gamut of educational activity, ranging from pre-school to tertiary level institutions.
1315	6248	Annual tuition fees at K-12 schools range from nothing at so called 'tuition-free' schools to more than $45,000 at several New England preparatory schools.
1316	6249	The secondary level includes schools offering years 7 through 12 (year twelve is known as lower sixth) and year 13 (upper sixth).
1316	6250	This category includes university-preparatory schools or "prep schools", boarding schools and day schools.
1316	6251	Tuition at private secondary schools varies from school to school and depends on many factors, including the location of the school, the willingness of parents to pay, peer tuitions and the school's financial endowment.
1316	6252	High tuition, schools claim, is used to pay higher salaries for the best teachers and also used to provide enriched learning environments, including a low student to teacher ratio, small class sizes and services, such as libraries, science laboratories and computers.
1316	6253	Some private schools are boarding schools and many military academies are privately owned or operated as well.
1317	6254	Religiously affiliated and denominational schools form a subcategory of private schools.
1317	6255	Some such schools teach religious education, together with the usual academic subjects to impress their particular faith's beliefs and traditions in the students who attend.
1317	6256	Others use the denomination as more of a general label to describe on what the founders based their belief, while still maintaining a fine distinction between academics and religion.
1317	6257	They include parochial schools, a term which is often used to denote Roman Catholic schools.
1317	6258	Other religious groups represented in the K-12 private education sector include Protestants, Jews, Muslims and the Orthodox Christians.
1318	6259	Private schools in Australia may be favoured for many reasons: prestige and the social status of the 'old school tie'; better quality physical infrastructure and more facilities (e.g.
1318	6260	), higher-paid teachers; and/or the belief that private schools offer a higher quality of education.
1318	6261	Some schools offer the removal of the purported distractions of co-education; the presence of boarding facilities; or stricter discipline based on their power of expulsion, a tool not readily available to government schools.
1318	6262	Student uniforms for Australian private schools are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example, a compulsory blazer.
1318	6263	Private schools in Australia are always more expensive than their public counterparts.
1319	6264	Although most are non-aligned, some of the best known independent schools also belong to the large, long-established religious foundations, such as the Anglican Church, Uniting Church and Presbyterian Church, but in most cases, they do not insist on their students’ religious allegiance.
1319	6265	These schools are typically viewed as 'elite schools'.
1319	6266	Many of the 'grammar schools' also fall in this category.
1319	6267	They are usually expensive schools that tend to be up-market and traditional in style, some Catholic schools fall into this category as well, e.g.
1319	6268	St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace, Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview, St Gregory's College, Campbelltown, St Aloysius' College (Sydney) and St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill, as well as Loreto Kirribilli, Monte Sant Angelo Mercy College, St Ursula's College and Loreto Normanhurst for girls.
1320	6269	The right to create private schools in Germany is in Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz and cannot be suspended even in a state of emergency.
1320	6270	It is also not possible to abolish these rights.
1320	6271	This unusual protection of private schools was implemented to protect these schools from a second Gleichschaltung or similar event in the future.
1320	6272	Still, they are less common than in many other countries.
1320	6273	Overall, between 1992 and 2008 the percent of pupils in such schools in Germany increased from 6.1% to 7.8% (including rise from 0.5% to 6.1% in the former GDR).
1320	6274	Percent of students in private high schools reached 11.1%.
1321	6275	Ersatzschulen are ordinary primary or secondary schools, which are run by private individuals, private organizations or religious groups.
1321	6276	These schools offer the same types of diplomas as public schools.
1321	6277	Ersatzschulen lack the freedom to operate completely outside of government regulation.
1321	6278	Teachers at Ersatzschulen must have at least the same education and at least the same wages as teachers at public schools, an Ersatzschule must have at least the same academic standards as a public school and Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz, also forbids segregation of pupils according to the means of their parents (the so-called Sonderungsverbot).
1321	6279	Therefore, most Ersatzschulen have very low tuition fees and/or offer scholarships, compared to most other Western European countries.
1321	6280	However, it is not possible to finance these schools with such low tuition fees, which is why all German Ersatzschulen are additionally financed with public funds.
1321	6281	The percentages of public money could reach 100% of the personnel expenditures.
1321	6282	Nevertheless, Private Schools became insolvent in the past in Germany.
1322	6283	Ergänzungsschulen are secondary or post-secondary (non-tertiary) schools, which are run by private individuals, private organizations or rarely, religious groups and offer a type of education which is not available at public schools.
1322	6284	Most of these schools are vocational schools.
1322	6285	However, these vocational schools are not part of the German dual education system.
1322	6286	Ergänzungsschulen have the freedom to operate outside of government regulation and are funded in whole by charging their students tuition fees.
1323	6287	In India, private schools are called independent schools, but since some private schools receive financial aid from the government, it can be an aided or an unaided school.
1323	6288	So, in a strict sense, a private school is an unaided independent school.
1323	6289	For the purpose of this definition, only receipt of financial aid is considered, not land purchased from the government at a subsidized rate.
1323	6290	It is within the power of both the union government and the state governments to govern schools since Education appears in the Concurrent list of legislative subjects in the constitution.
1323	6291	The practice has been for the union government to provide the broad policy directions while the states create their own rules and regulations for the administration of the sector.
1323	6292	Among other things, this has also resulted in 30 different Examination Boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates.
1323	6293	Prominent Examination Boards that are present in multiple states are the CBSE and the CISCE, NENBSE
1324	6294	Legally, only non-profit trusts and societies can run schools in India.
1324	6295	They will have to satisfy a number of infrastructure and human resource related criteria to get Recognition (a form of license) from the government.
1324	6296	Critics of this system point out that this leads to corruption by school inspectors who check compliance and to fewer schools in a country that has the largest adult illiterate population in the world.
1324	6297	While official data does not capture the real extent of private schooling in the country, various studies have reported unpopularity of government schools and an increasing number of private schools.
1324	6298	The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), which evaluates learning levels in rural India, has been reporting poorer academic achievement in government schools than in private schools.
1324	6299	A key difference between the government and private schools is that the medium of education in private schools is English while it is the local language in government schools.
1325	6300	In Ireland, private schools (Irish: scoil phríobháideach) are unusual because a certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the State.
1325	6301	If the school wishes to employ extra teachers they are paid for with school fees, which tend to be relatively low in Ireland compared to the rest of the world.
1325	6302	There is, however, a limited element of state assessment of private schools, because of the requirement that the state ensure that children receive a certain minimum education; Irish private schools must still work towards the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate, for example.
1325	6303	Many private schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools.
1325	6304	The average fee is around €5,000 annually for most schools, but some of these schools also provide boarding and the fees may then rise up to €25,000 per year.
1325	6305	The fee-paying schools are usually run by a religious order, i.e., the Society of Jesus or Congregation of Christian Brothers, etc.
1326	6306	After Malaysia's independence in 1957, the government instructed all schools to surrender their properties and be assimilated into the National School system.
1326	6307	This caused an uproar among the Chinese and a compromise was achieved in that the schools would instead become "National Type" schools.
1326	6308	Under such a system, the government is only in charge of the school curriculum and teaching personnel while the lands still belonged to the schools.
1326	6309	While Chinese primary schools were allowed to retain Chinese as the medium of instruction, Chinese secondary schools are required to change into English-medium schools.
1326	6310	Over 60 schools converted to become National Type schools.
1327	6311	The other category of schools are those run and partly or fully funded by private individuals, private organizations and religious groups.
1327	6312	The ones that accept government funds are called 'aided' schools.
1327	6313	The private 'un-aided' schools are fully funded by private parties.
1327	6314	The standard and the quality of education is quite high.
1327	6315	Technically, these would be categorized as private schools, but many of them have the name "Public School" appended to them, e.g., the Galaxy Public School in Kathmandu.
1327	6316	Most of the middle-class families send their children to such schools, which might be in their own city or far off, like boarding schools.
1327	6317	The medium of education is English, but as a compulsory subject, Nepali and/or the state's official language is also taught.
1327	6318	Preschool education is mostly limited to organized neighbourhood nursery schools.
1328	6319	As of April 2014, there are 88 private schools in New Zealand, catering for around 28,000 students or 3.7% of the entire student population.
1328	6320	Private school numbers have been in decline since the mid-1970s as a result of many private schools opting to become state-integrated schools, mostly due of financial difficulties stemming from changes in student numbers and/or the economy.
1328	6321	State-integrated schools keep their private school special character and receives state funds in return for having to operate like a state school, e.g.
1328	6322	they must teach the state curriculum, they must employ registered teachers, and they can't charge tuition fees (they can charge "attendance dues" for the upkeep on the still-private school land and buildings).
1328	6323	The largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984, when the nation's then-private Catholic school system integrated.
1328	6324	As a result, private schools in New Zealand are now largely restricted to the largest cities (Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch) and niche markets.
1329	6325	Private schools are often Anglican, such as King's College and Diocesan School for Girls in Auckland, St Paul's Collegiate School in Hamilton, St Peter's School in Cambridge, Samuel Marsden Collegiate School in Wellington, and Christ's College and St Margaret's College in Christchurch; or Presbyterian, such as Saint Kentigern College and St Cuthbert's College in Auckland, Scots College and Queen Margaret College in Wellington, and St Andrew's College and Rangi Ruru Girls' School in Christchurch.
1329	6326	Academic Colleges Group is a recent group of private schools run as a business, with schools throughout Auckland, including ACG Senior College in Auckland’s CBD, ACG Parnell College in Parnell, and international school ACG New Zealand International College.
1329	6327	There are three private schools (including the secondary school, St Dominic's College) operated by the Catholic schismatic group, the Society of St Pius X in Wanganui.
1330	6328	In the Philippines, the private sector has been a major provider of educational services, accounting for about 7.5% of primary enrollment, 32% of secondary enrollment and about 80% of tertiary enrollment.
1330	6329	Private schools have proven to be efficient in resource utilization.
1330	6330	Per unit costs in private schools are generally lower when compared to public schools.
1330	6331	This situation is more evident at the tertiary level.
1330	6332	Government regulations have given private education more flexibility and autonomy in recent years, notably by lifting the moratorium on applications for new courses, new schools and conversions, by liberalizing tuition fee policy for private schools, by replacing values education for third and fourth years with English, mathematics and natural science at the option of the school, and by issuing the revised Manual of Regulations for Private Schools in August 1992.
1331	6333	The Education Service Contracting scheme of the government provides financial assistance for tuition and other school fees of students turned away from public high schools because of enrollment overflows.
1331	6334	The Tuition Fee Supplement is geared to students enrolled in priority courses in post-secondary and non-degree programmes, including vocational and technical courses.
1331	6335	The Private Education Student Financial Assistance is made available to underprivileged, but deserving high school graduates, who wish to pursue college/technical education in private colleges and universities.
1332	6336	Some of the oldest schools in South Africa are private church schools that were established by missionaries in the early nineteenth century.
1332	6337	The private sector has grown ever since.
1332	6338	After the abolition of apartheid, the laws governing private education in South Africa changed significantly.
1332	6339	The South African Schools Act of 1996 recognises two categories of schools: "public" (state-controlled) and "independent" (which includes traditional private schools and schools which are privately governed[clarification needed].)
1333	6340	In the final years of the apartheid era, parents at white government schools were given the option to convert to a "semi-private" form called Model C, and many of these schools changed their admissions policies to accept children of other races.
1333	6341	Following the transition to democracy, the legal form of "Model C" was abolished, however, the term continues to be used to describe government schools formerly reserved for white children..
1333	6342	These schools tend to produce better academic results than government schools formerly reserved for other race groups .
1333	6343	Former "Model C" schools are not private schools, as they are state-controlled.
1333	6344	All schools in South Africa (including both independent schools and public schools) have the right to set compulsory school fees, and formerly model C schools tend to set much higher school fees than other public schools.
1334	6345	In Sweden, pupils are free to choose a private school and the private school gets paid the same amount as municipal schools.
1334	6346	Over 10% of Swedish pupils were enrolled in private schools in 2008.
1334	6347	Sweden is internationally known for this innovative school voucher model that provides Swedish pupils with the opportunity to choose the school they prefer.
1334	6348	For instance, the biggest school chain, Kunskapsskolan (“The Knowledge School”), offers 30 schools and a web-based environment, has 700 employees and teaches nearly 10,000 pupils.
1334	6349	The Swedish system has been recommended to Barack Obama.
1335	6350	Private schools generally prefer to be called independent schools, because of their freedom to operate outside of government and local government control.
1335	6351	Some of these are also known as public schools.
1335	6352	Preparatory schools in the UK prepare pupils aged up to 13 years old to enter public schools.
1335	6353	The name "public school" is based on the fact that the schools were open to pupils from anywhere, and not merely to those from a certain locality, and of any religion or occupation.
1335	6354	According to The Good Schools Guide approximately 9 per cent of children being educated in the UK are doing so at fee-paying schools at GSCE level and 13 per cent at A-level.
1335	6355	[citation needed] Many independent schools are single-sex (though this is becoming less common).
1335	6356	Fees range from under £3,000 to £21,000 and above per year for day pupils, rising to £27,000+ per year for boarders.
1335	6357	For details in Scotland, see "Meeting the Cost".
1336	6358	In many parts of the United States, after the 1954 decision in the landmark court case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka that demanded United States schools desegregate "with all deliberate speed", local families organized a wave of private "Christian academies".
1336	6359	In much of the U.S. South, many white students migrated to the academies, while public schools became in turn more heavily concentrated with African-American students (see List of private schools in Mississippi).
1336	6360	The academic content of the academies was usually College Preparatory.
1336	6361	Since the 1970s, many of these "segregation academies" have shut down, although some continue to operate.
1337	6362	Funding for private schools is generally provided through student tuition, endowments, scholarship/voucher funds, and donations and grants from religious organizations or private individuals.
1337	6363	Government funding for religious schools is either subject to restrictions or possibly forbidden, according to the courts' interpretation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment or individual state Blaine Amendments.
1337	6364	Non-religious private schools theoretically could qualify for such funding without hassle, preferring the advantages of independent control of their student admissions and course content instead of the public funding they could get with charter status.
1338	6365	Private schooling in the United States has been debated by educators, lawmakers and parents, since the beginnings of compulsory education in Massachusetts in 1852.
1338	6366	The Supreme Court precedent appears to favor educational choice, so long as states may set standards for educational accomplishment.
1338	6367	Some of the most relevant Supreme Court case law on this is as follows: Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160 (1976); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923).
1339	6368	As of 2012, quality private schools in the United States charged substantial tuition, close to $40,000 annually for day schools in New York City, and nearly $50,000 for boarding schools.
1339	6369	However, tuition did not cover operating expenses, particularly at boarding schools.
1339	6370	The leading schools such as the Groton School had substantial endowments running to hundreds of millions of dollars supplemented by fundraising drives.
1339	6371	Boarding schools with a reputation for quality in the United States have a student body drawn from throughout the country, indeed the globe, and a list of applicants which far exceeds their capacity.
1340	6372	Established originally by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard (its first benefactor), Harvard is the United States' oldest institution of higher learning, and the Harvard Corporation (formally, the President and Fellows of Harvard College) is its first chartered corporation.
1340	6373	Although never formally affiliated with any denomination, the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy.
1340	6374	Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites.
1340	6375	Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900.
1340	6376	James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war.
1340	6377	The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.
1341	6378	Harvard is a large, highly residential research university.
1341	6379	The nominal cost of attendance is high, but the University's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages.
1341	6380	It operates several arts, cultural, and scientific museums, alongside the Harvard Library, which is the world's largest academic and private library system, comprising 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes.
1341	6381	Harvard's alumni include eight U.S. presidents, several foreign heads of state, 62 living billionaires, 335 Rhodes Scholars, and 242 Marshall Scholars.
1341	6382	To date, some 150 Nobel laureates, 18 Fields Medalists and 13 Turing Award winners have been affiliated as students, faculty, or staff.
1342	6383	The University is organized into eleven separate academic units—ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study—with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area: its 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately 3 miles (5 km) northwest of Boston; the business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical, dental, and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area.
1342	6384	Harvard's $37.6 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution.
1343	6385	Harvard was formed in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
1343	6386	It was initially called "New College" or "the college at New Towne".
1343	6387	In 1638, the college became home for North America's first known printing press, carried by the ship John of London.
1343	6388	In 1639, the college was renamed Harvard College after deceased clergyman John Harvard, who was an alumnus of the University of Cambridge.
1343	6389	He had left the school £779 and his library of some 400 books.
1343	6390	The charter creating the Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.
1344	6391	In the early years the College trained many Puritan ministers.
1344	6392	[citation needed] (A 1643 publication said the school's purpose was "to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust".)
1344	6393	It offered a classic curriculum on the English university model—​​many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge—​​but conformed Puritanism.
1344	6394	It was never affiliated with any particular denomination, but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in Congregational and Unitarian churches.
1345	6395	Throughout the 18th century, Enlightenment ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among Congregationalist ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.
1345	6396	:1–4 When the Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later, in 1804, a struggle broke out over their replacements.
1345	6397	Henry Ware was elected to the chair in 1805, and the liberal Samuel Webber was appointed to the presidency of Harvard two years later, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, Arminian ideas (defined by traditionalists as Unitarian ideas).
1346	6398	In 1846, the natural history lectures of Louis Agassiz were acclaimed both in New York and on the campus at Harvard College.
1346	6399	Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' "participation in the Divine Nature" and the possibility of understanding "intellectual existences".
1346	6400	Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the "divine plan" in all phenomena.
1346	6401	When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence.
1346	6402	This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time.
1346	6403	The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to "soar with Plato" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norrisand, in a Romantic vein, Samuel Coleridge.
1346	6404	The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the "official philosophy" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.
1347	6405	Charles W. Eliot, president 1869–1909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction.
1347	6406	While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions.
1347	6407	Derived from William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson, these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature, the right and ability of each person to perceive truth, and the indwelling God in each person.
1348	6408	James Bryant Conant (president, 1933–1953) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions.
1348	6409	He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth.
1348	6410	In 1943, he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as the college level.
1348	6411	The resulting Report, published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century.
1349	6412	Women remained segregated at Radcliffe, though more and more took Harvard classes.
1349	6413	Nonetheless, Harvard's undergraduate population remained predominantly male, with about four men attending Harvard College for every woman studying at Radcliffe.
1349	6414	Following the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe admissions in 1977, the proportion of female undergraduates steadily increased, mirroring a trend throughout higher education in the United States.
1349	6415	Harvard's graduate schools, which had accepted females and other groups in greater numbers even before the college, also became more diverse in the post-World War II period.
1350	6416	Harvard's 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, about 3 miles (5 km) west-northwest of the State House in downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood.
1350	6417	Harvard Yard itself contains the central administrative offices and main libraries of the university, academic buildings including Sever Hall and University Hall, Memorial Church, and the majority of the freshman dormitories.
1350	6418	Sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduates live in twelve residential Houses, nine of which are south of Harvard Yard along or near the Charles River.
1350	6419	The other three are located in a residential neighborhood half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Quadrangle (commonly referred to as the Quad), which formerly housed Radcliffe College students until Radcliffe merged its residential system with Harvard.
1350	6420	Each residential house contains rooms for undergraduates, House masters, and resident tutors, as well as a dining hall and library.
1350	6421	The facilities were made possible by a gift from Yale University alumnus Edward Harkness.
1351	6422	The Harvard Business School and many of the university's athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus opposite the Cambridge campus in Allston.
1351	6423	The John W. Weeks Bridge is a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River connecting both campuses.
1351	6424	The Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and the Harvard School of Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area approximately 3.3 miles (5.3 km) southwest of downtown Boston and 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.
1352	6425	Harvard has purchased tracts of land in Allston, a walk across the Charles River from Cambridge, with the intent of major expansion southward.
1352	6426	The university now owns approximately fifty percent more land in Allston than in Cambridge.
1352	6427	Proposals to connect the Cambridge campus with the new Allston campus include new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a tram.
1352	6428	Plans also call for sinking part of Storrow Drive (at Harvard's expense) for replacement with park land and pedestrian access to the Charles River, as well as the construction of bike paths, and buildings throughout the Allston campus.
1352	6429	The institution asserts that such expansion will benefit not only the school, but surrounding community, pointing to such features as the enhanced transit infrastructure, possible shuttles open to the public, and park space which will also be publicly accessible.
1353	6430	Harvard's 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors instruct 7,200 undergraduates and 14,000 graduate students.
1353	6431	The school color is crimson, which is also the name of the Harvard sports teams and the daily newspaper, The Harvard Crimson.
1353	6432	The color was unofficially adopted (in preference to magenta) by an 1875 vote of the student body, although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858, when Charles William Eliot, a young graduate student who would later become Harvard's 21st and longest-serving president (1869–1909), bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta.
1354	6433	Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world.
1354	6434	As of September 2011[update], it had nearly regained the loss suffered during the 2008 recession.
1354	6435	It was worth $32 billion in 2011, up from $28 billion in September 2010 and $26 billion in 2009.
1354	6436	It suffered about 30% loss in 2008-09.
1354	6437	In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately $8 billion) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts.
1354	6438	Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone.
1354	6439	Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $12 billion.
1354	6440	One of the most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of construction of the $1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in protests from local residents.
1354	6441	As of 2012[update], Harvard University had a total financial aid reserve of $159 million for students, and a Pell Grant reserve of $4.093 million available for disbursement.
1355	6442	During the divestment from South Africa movement in the late 1980s, student activists erected a symbolic "shantytown" on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech given by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.
1355	6443	The Harvard Management Company repeatedly refused to divest, stating that "operating expenses must not be subject to financially unrealistic strictures or carping by the unsophisticated or by special interest groups."
1355	6444	However, the university did eventually reduce its South African holdings by $230 million (out of $400 million) in response to the pressure.
1356	6445	Undergraduate admission to Harvard is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation as "more selective, lower transfer-in".
1356	6446	Harvard College accepted 5.3% of applicants for the class of 2019, a record low and the second lowest acceptance rate among all national universities.
1356	6447	Harvard College ended its early admissions program in 2007 as the program was believed to disadvantage low-income and under-represented minority applicants applying to selective universities, yet for the class of 2016 an Early Action program was reintroduced.
1357	6448	The four-year, full-time undergraduate program comprises a minority of enrollments at the university and emphasizes instruction with an "arts and sciences focus".
1357	6449	Between 1978 and 2008, entering students were required to complete a core curriculum of seven classes outside of their concentration.
1357	6450	Since 2008, undergraduate students have been required to complete courses in eight General Education categories: Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding, Culture and Belief, Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning, Ethical Reasoning, Science of Living Systems, Science of the Physical Universe, Societies of the World, and United States in the World.
1357	6451	Harvard offers a comprehensive doctoral graduate program and there is a high level of coexistence between graduate and undergraduate degrees.
1357	6452	The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, The New York Times, and some students have criticized Harvard for its reliance on teaching fellows for some aspects of undergraduate education; they consider this to adversely affect the quality of education.
1358	6453	Harvard's academic programs operate on a semester calendar beginning in early September and ending in mid-May.
1358	6454	Undergraduates typically take four half-courses per term and must maintain a four-course rate average to be considered full-time.
1358	6455	In many concentrations, students can elect to pursue a basic program or an honors-eligible program requiring a senior thesis and/or advanced course work.
1358	6456	Students graduating in the top 4–5% of the class are awarded degrees summa cum laude, students in the next 15% of the class are awarded magna cum laude, and the next 30% of the class are awarded cum laude.
1358	6457	Harvard has chapters of academic honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa and various committees and departments also award several hundred named prizes annually.
1358	6458	Harvard, along with other universities, has been accused of grade inflation, although there is evidence that the quality of the student body and its motivation have also increased.
1358	6459	Harvard College reduced the number of students who receive Latin honors from 90% in 2004 to 60% in 2005.
1358	6460	Moreover, the honors of "John Harvard Scholar" and "Harvard College Scholar" will now be given only to the top 5 percent and the next 5 percent of each class.
1359	6461	For the 2012–13 school year annual tuition was $38,000, with a total cost of attendance of $57,000.
1359	6462	Beginning 2007, families with incomes below $60,000 pay nothing for their children to attend, including room and board.
1359	6463	Families with incomes between $60,000 to $80,000 pay only a few thousand dollars per year, and families earning between $120,000 and $180,000 pay no more than 10% of their annual incomes.
1359	6464	In 2009, Harvard offered grants totaling $414 million across all eleven divisions;[further explanation needed] $340 million came from institutional funds, $35 million from federal support, and $39 million from other outside support.
1359	6465	Grants total 88% of Harvard's aid for undergraduate students, with aid also provided by loans (8%) and work-study (4%).
1360	6466	The Harvard University Library System is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding over 18 million volumes.
1360	6467	According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the United States, and one of the largest in the world.
1360	6468	Cabot Science Library, Lamont Library, and Widener Library are three of the most popular libraries for undergraduates to use, with easy access and central locations.
1360	6469	There are rare books, manuscripts and other special collections throughout Harvard's libraries; Houghton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials.
1360	6470	America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public.
1360	6471	The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard-Yenching Library.
1361	6472	Harvard operates several arts, cultural, and scientific museums.
1361	6473	The Harvard Art Museums comprises three museums.
1361	6474	The Arthur M. Sackler Museum includes collections of ancient, Asian, Islamic and later Indian art, the Busch-Reisinger Museum, formerly the Germanic Museum, covers central and northern European art, and the Fogg Museum of Art, covers Western art from the Middle Ages to the present emphasizing Italian early Renaissance, British pre-Raphaelite, and 19th-century French art.
1361	6475	The Harvard Museum of Natural History includes the Harvard Mineralogical Museum, Harvard University Herbaria featuring the Blaschka Glass Flowers exhibit, and the Museum of Comparative Zoology.
1361	6476	Other museums include the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, designed by Le Corbusier, housing the film archive, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, specializing in the cultural history and civilizations of the Western Hemisphere, and the Semitic Museum featuring artifacts from excavations in the Middle East.
1362	6477	Harvard has been highly ranked by many university rankings.
1362	6478	In particular, it has consistently topped the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) since 2003, and the THE World Reputation Rankings since 2011, when the first time such league tables were published.
1362	6479	When the QS and Times were published in partnership as the THE-QS World University Rankings during 2004-2009, Harvard had also been regarded the first in every year.
1362	6480	The University's undergraduate program has been continuously among the top two in the U.S. News & World Report.
1362	6481	In 2014, Harvard topped the University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP).
1362	6482	It was ranked 8th on the 2013-2014 PayScale College Salary Report and 14th on the 2013 PayScale College Education Value Rankings.
1362	6483	From a poll done by The Princeton Review, Harvard is the second most commonly named "dream college", both for students and parents in 2013, and was the first nominated by parents in 2009.
1362	6484	In 2011, the Mines ParisTech : Professional Ranking World Universities ranked Harvard 1st university in the world in terms of number of alumni holding CEO position in Fortune Global 500 companies.
1363	6485	The Harvard Crimson competes in 42 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division I Ivy League.
1363	6486	Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with Yale University culminating in The Game, although the Harvard–Yale Regatta predates the football game.
1363	6487	This rivalry, though, is put aside every two years when the Harvard and Yale Track and Field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team, a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.
1364	6488	Harvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply "The Game".
1364	6489	While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played.
1364	6490	In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country.
1364	6491	The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game.
1364	6492	Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game.
1364	6493	But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface.
1364	6494	So, other steps had to be taken.
1364	6495	Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season.
1364	6496	These included legalizing the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.
1365	6497	Harvard has several athletic facilities, such as the Lavietes Pavilion, a multi-purpose arena and home to the Harvard basketball teams.
1365	6498	The Malkin Athletic Center, known as the "MAC", serves both as the university's primary recreation facility and as a satellite location for several varsity sports.
1365	6499	The five-story building includes two cardio rooms, an Olympic-size swimming pool, a smaller pool for aquaerobics and other activities, a mezzanine, where all types of classes are held, an indoor cycling studio, three weight rooms, and a three-court gym floor to play basketball.
1365	6500	The MAC offers personal trainers and specialty classes.
1365	6501	It is home to Harvard volleyball, fencing and wrestling.
1365	6502	The offices of several of the school's varsity coaches are also in the MAC.
1366	6503	Older than The Game by 23 years, the Harvard-Yale Regatta was the original source of the athletic rivalry between the two schools.
1366	6504	It is held annually in June on the Thames River in eastern Connecticut.
1366	6505	The Harvard crew is typically considered to be one of the top teams in the country in rowing.
1366	6506	Today, Harvard fields top teams in several other sports, such as the Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey team (with a strong rivalry against Cornell), squash, and even recently won NCAA titles in Men's and Women's Fencing.
1366	6507	Harvard also won the Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships in 2003.

1370	6510	Jacksonville is the largest city by population in the U.S. state of Florida, and the largest city by area in the contiguous United States.
1370	6511	It is the county seat of Duval County, with which the city government consolidated in 1968.
1370	6512	Consolidation gave Jacksonville its great size and placed most of its metropolitan population within the city limits; with an estimated population of 853,382 in 2014, it is the most populous city proper in Florida and the Southeast, and the 12th most populous in the United States.
1370	6513	Jacksonville is the principal city in the Jacksonville metropolitan area, with a population of 1,345,596 in 2010.
1371	6514	Jacksonville is in the First Coast region of northeast Florida and is centered on the banks of the St. Johns River, about 25 miles (40 km) south of the Georgia state line and about 340 miles (550 km) north of Miami.
1371	6515	The Jacksonville Beaches communities are along the adjacent Atlantic coast.
1371	6516	The area was originally inhabited by the Timucua people, and in 1564 was the site of the French colony of Fort Caroline, one of the earliest European settlements in what is now the continental United States.
1371	6517	Under British rule, settlement grew at the narrow point in the river where cattle crossed, known as Wacca Pilatka to the Seminole and the Cow Ford to the British.
1371	6518	A platted town was established there in 1822, a year after the United States gained Florida from Spain; it was named after Andrew Jackson, the first military governor of the Florida Territory and seventh President of the United States.
1372	6519	Harbor improvements since the late 19th century have made Jacksonville a major military and civilian deep-water port.
1372	6520	Its riverine location facilitates two United States Navy bases and the Port of Jacksonville, Florida's third largest seaport.
1372	6521	The two US Navy bases, Blount Island Command and the nearby Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay form the third largest military presence in the United States.
1372	6522	Significant factors in the local economy include services such as banking, insurance, healthcare and logistics.
1372	6523	As with much of Florida, tourism is also important to the Jacksonville area, particularly tourism related to golf.
1372	6524	People from Jacksonville may be called "Jacksonvillians" or "Jaxsons" (also spelled "Jaxons").
1373	6525	The area of the modern city of Jacksonville has been inhabited for thousands of years.
1373	6526	On Black Hammock Island in the national Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, a University of North Florida team discovered some of the oldest remnants of pottery in the United States, dating to 2500 BC.
1373	6527	In the 16th century, the beginning of the historical era, the region was inhabited by the Mocama, a coastal subgroup of the Timucua people.
1373	6528	At the time of contact with Europeans, all Mocama villages in present-day Jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom known as the Saturiwa, centered around the mouth of the St. Johns River.
1373	6529	One early map shows a village called Ossachite at the site of what is now downtown Jacksonville; this may be the earliest recorded name for that area.
1374	6530	French Huguenot explorer Jean Ribault charted the St. Johns River in 1562 calling it the River of May because he discovered it in May.
1374	6531	Ribault erected a stone column near present-day Jacksonville claiming the newly discovered land for France.
1374	6532	In 1564, René Goulaine de Laudonnière established the first European settlement, Fort Caroline, on the St. Johns near the main village of the Saturiwa.
1374	6533	Philip II of Spain ordered Pedro Menéndez de Avilés to protect the interest of Spain by attacking the French presence at Fort Caroline.
1374	6534	On September 20, 1565, a Spanish force from the nearby Spanish settlement of St. Augustine attacked Fort Caroline, and killed nearly all the French soldiers defending it.
1374	6535	The Spanish renamed the fort San Mateo, and following the ejection of the French, St. Augustine's position as the most important settlement in Florida was solidified.
1374	6536	The location of Fort Caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the St. Johns River in 1964.
1375	6537	Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763 after the French and Indian War, and the British soon constructed the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia.
1375	6538	The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford or Cowford; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there.
1375	6539	The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber.
1375	6540	As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish.
1375	6541	Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow.
1375	6542	After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats.
1375	6543	They soon named the town Jacksonville, after Andrew Jackson.
1375	6544	Led by Isaiah D. Hart, residents wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832.
1376	6545	During the American Civil War, Jacksonville was a key supply point for hogs and cattle being shipped from Florida to aid the Confederate cause.
1376	6546	The city was blockaded by Union forces, who gained control of the nearby Fort Clinch.
1376	6547	Though no battles were fought in Jacksonville proper, the city changed hands several times between Union and Confederate forces.
1376	6548	The Skirmish of the Brick Church in 1862 just outside Jacksonville proper resulted in the first Confederate victory in Florida.
1376	6549	In February 1864 Union forces left Jacksonville and confronted a Confederate Army at the Battle of Olustee resulting in a Confederate victory.
1376	6550	Union forces then retreated to Jacksonville and held the city for the remainder of the war.
1376	6551	In March 1864 a Confederate cavalry confronted a Union expedition resulting in the Battle of Cedar Creek.
1376	6552	Warfare and the long occupation left the city disrupted after the war.
1377	6553	During Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, Jacksonville and nearby St. Augustine became popular winter resorts for the rich and famous.
1377	6554	Visitors arrived by steamboat and later by railroad.
1377	6555	President Grover Cleveland attended the Sub-Tropical Exposition in the city on February 22, 1888 during his trip to Florida.
1377	6556	This highlighted the visibility of the state as a worthy place for tourism.
1377	6557	The city's tourism, however, was dealt major blows in the late 19th century by yellow fever outbreaks.
1377	6558	In addition, extension of the Florida East Coast Railway further south drew visitors to other areas.
1377	6559	From 1893 to 1938 Jacksonville was the site of the Florida Old Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Home with a nearby cemetery.
1378	6560	On May 3, 1901, downtown Jacksonville was ravaged by a fire that started as a kitchen fire.
1378	6561	Spanish moss at a nearby mattress factory was quickly engulfed in flames and enabling the fire to spread rapidly.
1378	6562	In just eight hours, it swept through 146 city blocks, destroyed over 2,000 buildings, left about 10,000 homeless and killed 7 residents.
1378	6563	The Confederate Monument in Hemming Park was one of the only landmarks to survive the fire.
1378	6564	Governor Jennings declare martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order.
1378	6565	On May 17 municipal authority resumed in Jacksonville.
1378	6566	It is said the glow from the flames could be seen in Savannah, Georgia, and the smoke plumes seen in Raleigh, North Carolina.
1378	6567	Known as the "Great Fire of 1901", it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern United States.
1378	6568	Architect Henry John Klutho was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city.
1378	6569	The first multi-story structure built by Klutho was the Dyal-Upchurch Building in 1902.
1378	6570	The St. James Building, built on the previous site of the St. James Hotel that burned down, was built in 1912 as Klutho's crowning achievement.
1379	6571	In the 1910s, New York–based filmmakers were attracted to Jacksonville's warm climate, exotic locations, excellent rail access, and cheap labor.
1379	6572	Over the course of the decade, more than 30 silent film studios were established, earning Jacksonville the title of "Winter Film Capital of the World".
1379	6573	However, the emergence of Hollywood as a major film production center ended the city's film industry.
1379	6574	One converted movie studio site, Norman Studios, remains in Arlington; It has been converted to the Jacksonville Silent Film Museum at Norman Studios.
1380	6575	Jacksonville, like most large cities in the United States, suffered from negative effects of rapid urban sprawl after World War II.
1380	6576	The construction of highways led residents to move to newer housing in the suburbs.
1380	6577	After World War II, the government of the city of Jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the boom that occurred after the war.
1380	6578	Mayor W. Haydon Burns' Jacksonville Story resulted in the construction of a new city hall, civic auditorium, public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride.
1380	6579	However, the development of suburbs and a subsequent wave of middle class "white flight" left Jacksonville with a much poorer population than before.
1380	6580	The city's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, declined from 75.8% in 1970 to 55.1% by 2010.
1381	6581	Much of the city's tax base dissipated, leading to problems with funding education, sanitation, and traffic control within the city limits.
1381	6582	In addition, residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services, such as sewage and building code enforcement.
1381	6583	In 1958, a study recommended that the city of Jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities in order to create the needed tax base to improve services throughout the county.
1381	6584	Voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums between 1960 and 1965.
1382	6585	In the mid-1960s, corruption scandals began to arise among many of the city's officials, who were mainly elected through the traditional old boy network.
1382	6586	After a grand jury was convened to investigate, 11 officials were indicted and more were forced to resign.
1382	6587	Jacksonville Consolidation, led by J. J. Daniel and Claude Yates, began to win more support during this period, from both inner city blacks, who wanted more involvement in government, and whites in the suburbs, who wanted more services and more control over the central city.
1382	6588	In 1964 all 15 of Duval County's public high schools lost their accreditation.
1382	6589	This added momentum to proposals for government reform.
1382	6590	Lower taxes, increased economic development, unification of the community, better public spending and effective administration by a more central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated government.
1383	6591	When a consolidation referendum was held in 1967, voters approved the plan.
1383	6592	On October 1, 1968, the governments merged to create the Consolidated City of Jacksonville.
1383	6593	Fire, police, health & welfare, recreation, public works, and housing & urban development were all combined under the new government.
1383	6594	In honor of the occasion, then-Mayor Hans Tanzler posed with actress Lee Meredith behind a sign marking the new border of the "Bold New City of the South" at Florida 13 and Julington Creek.
1383	6595	The Better Jacksonville Plan, promoted as a blueprint for Jacksonville's future and approved by Jacksonville voters in 2000, authorized a half-penny sales tax.
1383	6596	This would generate most of the revenue required for the $2.25 billion package of major projects that included road & infrastructure improvements, environmental preservation, targeted economic development and new or improved public facilities.
1384	6597	According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 874.3 square miles (2,264 km2), making Jacksonville the largest city in land area in the contiguous United States; of this, 86.66% (757.7 sq mi or 1,962 km2) is land and ; 13.34% (116.7 sq mi or 302 km2) is water.
1384	6598	Jacksonville surrounds the town of Baldwin.
1384	6599	Nassau County lies to the north, Baker County lies to the west, and Clay and St. Johns County lie to the south; the Atlantic Ocean lies to the east, along with the Jacksonville Beaches.
1384	6600	The St. Johns River divides the city.
1384	6601	The Trout River, a major tributary of the St. Johns River, is located entirely within Jacksonville.
1385	6602	The tallest building in Downtown Jacksonville's skyline is the Bank of America Tower, constructed in 1990 as the Barnett Center.
1385	6603	It has a height of 617 ft (188 m) and includes 42 floors.
1385	6604	Other notable structures include the 37-story Wells Fargo Center (with its distinctive flared base making it the defining building in the Jacksonville skyline), originally built in 1972-74 by the Independent Life and Accident Insurance Company, and the 28 floor Riverplace Tower which, when completed in 1967, was the tallest precast, post-tensioned concrete structure in the world.
1386	6605	Like much of the south Atlantic region of the United States, Jacksonville has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), with mild weather during winters and hot and humid weather during summers.
1386	6606	Seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months from May through September, while the driest months are from November through April.
1386	6607	Due to Jacksonville's low latitude and coastal location, the city sees very little cold weather, and winters are typically mild and sunny.
1386	6608	Summers can be hot and wet, and summer thunderstorms with torrential but brief downpours are common.
1387	6609	Mean monthly temperatures range from around 53 F in January to 82 F in July.
1387	6610	High temperatures average 64 to 92 °F (18 to 33 °C) throughout the year.
1387	6611	High heat indices are common for the summer months in the area, with indices above 110 °F (43.3 °C) possible.
1387	6612	The highest temperature recorded was 104 °F (40 °C) on July 11, 1879 and July 28, 1872.
1387	6613	It is common for thunderstorms to erupt during a typical summer afternoon.
1387	6614	These are caused by the rapid heating of the land relative to the water, combined with extremely high humidity.
1388	6615	Jacksonville has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other east coast cities, although the threat does exist for a direct hit by a major hurricane.
1388	6616	The city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871; however, Jacksonville has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing past the area.
1388	6617	The strongest effect on Jacksonville was from Hurricane Dora in 1964, the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane-force winds.
1388	6618	The eye crossed St. Augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to 110 mph (180 km/h), making it a strong Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.
1388	6619	Jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008's Tropical Storm Fay which crisscrossed the state, bringing parts of Jacksonville under darkness for four days.
1388	6620	Similarly, four years prior to this, Jacksonville was inundated by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne, which made landfall south of the area.
1388	6621	These tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to Jacksonville.
1388	6622	Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to Jacksonville Beach.
1388	6623	During Floyd, the Jacksonville Beach pier was severely damaged, and later demolished.
1388	6624	The rebuilt pier was later damaged by Fay, but not destroyed.
1388	6625	Tropical Storm Bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004, spawning a minor tornado in the process.
1388	6626	On May 28, 2012, Jacksonville was hit by Tropical Storm Beryl, packing winds up to 70 miles per hour (113 km/h) which made landfall near Jacksonville Beach.
1389	6627	Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, and the twelfth most populous city in the United States.
1389	6628	As of 2010[update], there were 821,784 people and 366,273 households in the city.
1389	6629	Jacksonville has the country's tenth-largest Arab population, with a total population of 5,751 according to the 2000 United States Census.
1389	6630	Jacksonville has Florida's largest Filipino American community, with 25,033 in the metropolitan area as of the 2010 Census.
1389	6631	Much of Jacksonville's Filipino community served in or has ties to the United States Navy.
1390	6632	As of 2010[update], there were 366,273 households out of which 11.8% were vacant.
1390	6633	23.9% of households had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.8% were married couples, 15.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.4% were non-families.
1390	6634	29.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.
1390	6635	The average household size was 2.55 and the average family size was 3.21.
1390	6636	In the city, the population was spread out with 23.9% under the age of 18, 10.5% from 18 to 24, 28.5% from 25 to 44, 26.2% from 45 to 64, and 10.9% who were 65 years of age or older.
1390	6637	The median age was 35.5 years.
1390	6638	For every 100 females there were 94.1 males.
1390	6639	For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.3 males.
1391	6640	A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000.
1391	6641	The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined.
1391	6642	The combined wealth of the "10 million dollar millionaires" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008.
1391	6643	A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people.
1391	6644	According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population.
1391	6645	More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016.
1391	6646	An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession.
1391	6647	In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900.
1391	6648	A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined.
1391	6649	Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).
1391	6650	Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a "silly argument" and "a non-issue .
1392	6651	According to PolitiFact the top 400 richest Americans "have more wealth than half of all Americans combined."
1392	6652	According to the New York Times on July 22, 2014, the "richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent".
1392	6653	Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a "substantial head start".
1392	6654	In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, "over 60 percent" of the Forbes richest 400 Americans "grew up in substantial privilege".
1393	6655	Neoclassical economics views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor, capital and land.
1393	6656	Within labor income distribution is due to differences in value added by different classifications of workers.
1393	6657	In this perspective, wages and profits are determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor (worker, capitalist/business owner, landlord).
1393	6658	Thus, in a market economy, inequality is a reflection of the productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions.
1394	6659	In Marxian analysis, capitalist firms increasingly substitute capital equipment for labor inputs (workers) under competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits.
1394	6660	Over the long-term, this trend increases the organic composition of capital, meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs, increasing unemployment (the "reserve army of labour").
1394	6661	This process exerts a downward pressure on wages.
1394	6662	The substitution of capital equipment for labor (mechanization and automation) raises the productivity of each worker, resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class.
1395	6663	In a purely capitalist mode of production (i.e.
1395	6664	where professional and labor organizations cannot limit the number of workers) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations, or by the employer, but rather by the market.
1395	6665	Wages work in the same way as prices for any other good.
1395	6666	Thus, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill.
1395	6667	And therefore, inequality is driven by this price.
1395	6668	Under the law of supply and demand, the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker.
1395	6669	"On the other hand, markets can also concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society, and abuse workers and consumers."
1395	6670	"Markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair."
1395	6671	Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed.
1395	6672	Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor.
1395	6673	For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest, it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers.
1396	6674	A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time (high supply) competing for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job.
1396	6675	This is because competition between workers drives down the wage.
1396	6676	An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service.
1396	6677	Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job.
1396	6678	A job where there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job.
1396	6679	This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage.
1396	6680	Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk.
1396	6681	Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position.
1396	6682	Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members.
1396	6683	Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.
1397	6684	On the other hand, higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level (self-employment).
1397	6685	However, most of it is often based on necessity rather than opportunity.
1397	6686	Necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs such as income for food and shelter ("push" motivations), whereas opportunity-based entrepreneurship is driven by achievement-oriented motivations ("pull") such as vocation and more likely to involve the pursue of new products, services, or underserved market needs.
1397	6687	The economic impact of the former type of entrepreneurialism tends to be redistributive while the latter is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth.
1398	6688	Another cause is the rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system.
1398	6689	A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases.
1398	6690	In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change as a result of the change in tax regime.
1398	6691	Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board.
1398	6692	The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.
1399	6693	An important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals' access to education.
1399	6694	Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education, however, increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality.
1399	6695	As a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages.
1399	6696	The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment.
1399	6697	Conversely, education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor.
1400	6698	In 2014, economists with the Standard & Poor's rating agency concluded that the widening disparity between the U.S.'s wealthiest citizens and the rest of the nation had slowed its recovery from the 2008-2009 recession and made it more prone to boom-and-bust cycles.
1400	6699	To partially remedy the wealth gap and the resulting slow growth, S&P recommended increasing access to education.
1400	6700	It estimated that if the average United States worker had completed just one more year of school, it would add an additional $105 billion in growth to the country's economy over five years.
1401	6701	During the mass high school education movement from 1910–1940, there was an increase in skilled workers, which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor.
1401	6702	High school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work.
1401	6703	In fact, it differs from the present high school education, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees.
1401	6704	This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers.
1401	6705	Education is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy.
1401	6706	Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap.
1401	6707	It is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth, which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries.
1402	6708	John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer (2006) of the CEPR point to economic liberalism and the reduction of business regulation along with the decline of union membership as one of the causes of economic inequality.
1402	6709	In an analysis of the effects of intensive Anglo-American liberal policies in comparison to continental European liberalism, where unions have remained strong, they concluded "The U.S. economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion, including high levels of income inequality, high relative and absolute poverty rates, poor and unequal educational outcomes, poor health outcomes, and high rates of crime and incarceration.
1402	6710	At the same time, the available evidence provides little support for the view that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility dramatically improves labor-market outcomes.
1402	6711	Despite popular prejudices to the contrary, the U.S. economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is available."
1403	6712	Sociologist Jake Rosenfield of the University of Washington asserts that the decline of organized labor in the United States has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes and globalization, which were also experienced by other industrialized nations that didn't experience steep surges in inequality.
1403	6713	He points out that nations with high rates of unionization, particularly in Scandinavia, have very low levels of inequality, and concludes "the historical pattern is clear; the cross-national pattern is clear: high inequality goes hand-in-hand with weak labor movements and vice-versa."
1404	6714	Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale.
1404	6715	When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages.
1404	6716	Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States.
1404	6717	He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable.
1404	6718	However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts.
1404	6719	Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality.
1404	6720	They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes.
1404	6721	Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality.
1404	6722	Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.
1405	6723	In many countries, there is a Gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market.
1405	6724	Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap.
1405	6725	On average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work, and may be less willing to travel or relocate.
1405	6726	Thomas Sowell, in his book Knowledge and Decisions, claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy, but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference.
1405	6727	A U.S. Census's report stated that in US once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men.
1405	6728	The income gap in other countries ranges from 53% in Botswana to -40% in Bahrain.
1406	6729	Economist Simon Kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development.
1406	6730	According to Kuznets, countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth.
1406	6731	As a country develops, it acquires more capital, which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality.
1406	6732	Eventually, through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality.
1407	6733	Plotting the relationship between level of income and inequality, Kuznets saw middle-income developing economies level of inequality bulging out to form what is now known as the Kuznets curve.
1407	6734	Kuznets demonstrated this relationship using cross-sectional data.
1407	6735	However, more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak.
1407	6736	Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time.
1407	6737	As an example, income inequality did fall in the United States during its High school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter.
1407	6738	[citation needed] However, recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s.
1407	6739	This does not necessarily disprove Kuznets' theory.
1407	6740	[citation needed] It may be possible that another Kuznets' cycle is occurring, specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector.
1407	6741	[citation needed] This implies that it may be possible for multiple Kuznets' cycles to be in effect at any given time.
1408	6742	Wealth concentration is a theoretical[according to whom?]
1408	6743	process by which, under certain conditions, newly created wealth concentrates in the possession of already-wealthy individuals or entities.
1408	6744	According to this theory, those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth.
1408	6745	Over time, wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society.
1408	6746	Thomas Piketty in his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital (r) than economic growth (g), and that larger fortunes generate higher returns [pp.
1408	6747	384 Table 12.2, U.S. university endowment size vs. real annual rate of return]
1409	6748	Economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income, market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration, which may better be explained by the non-market force known as "rent-seeking".
1409	6749	While the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation, greater productivity, etc., it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices, profits and large compensation.
1409	6750	A better explainer of growing inequality, according to Stiglitz, is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them.
1409	6751	This process, known to economists as rent-seeking, brings income not from creation of wealth but from "grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort"
1410	6752	Effects of inequality researchers have found include higher rates of health and social problems, and lower rates of social goods, a lower level of economic utility in society from resources devoted on high-end consumption, and even a lower level of economic growth when human capital is neglected for high-end consumption.
1410	6753	For the top 21 industrialised countries, counting each person equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = -.907).
1410	6754	A similar relationship exists among US states (r = -.620).
1411	6755	2013 Economics Nobel prize winner Robert J. Shiller said that rising inequality in the United States and elsewhere is the most important problem.
1411	6756	High and persistent unemployment, in which inequality increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth.
1411	6757	Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict.
1411	6758	Policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth.
1412	6759	British researchers Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have found higher rates of health and social problems (obesity, mental illness, homicides, teenage births, incarceration, child conflict, drug use), and lower rates of social goods (life expectancy by country, educational performance, trust among strangers, women's status, social mobility, even numbers of patents issued) in countries and states with higher inequality.
1412	6760	Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US, they found social/health problems lower in countries like Japan and Finland and states like Utah and New Hampshire with high levels of equality, than in countries (US and UK) and states (Mississippi and New York) with large differences in household income.
1413	6761	For most of human history higher material living standards – full stomachs, access to clean water and warmth from fuel – led to better health and longer lives.
1413	6762	This pattern of higher incomes-longer lives still holds among poorer countries, where life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases, but in recent decades it has slowed down among middle income countries and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world.
1413	6763	Americans live no longer on average (about 77 years in 2004) than Greeks (78 years) or New Zealanders (78), though the USA has a higher GDP per capita.
1413	6764	Life expectancy in Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82) – where income was more equally distributed – was longer.
1414	6765	In recent years the characteristic that has strongly correlated with health in developed countries is income inequality.
1414	6766	Creating an index of "Health and Social Problems" from nine factors, authors Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett found health and social problems "more common in countries with bigger income inequalities", and more common among states in the US with larger income inequalities.
1414	6767	Other studies have confirmed this relationship.
1414	6768	The UNICEF index of "child well-being in rich countries", studying 40 indicators in 22 countries, correlates with greater equality but not per capita income.
1415	6769	Crime rate has also been shown to be correlated with inequality in society.
1415	6770	Most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides – since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions.
1415	6771	There have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger.
1415	6772	Research has been conducted comparing developed countries with undeveloped countries, as well as studying areas within countries.
1415	6773	2001 found that among U.S States and Canadian Provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality.
1415	6774	They estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state.
1415	6775	(2002) found a similar relationship worldwide.
1415	6776	Among comments in academic literature on the relationship between homicides and inequality are:
1416	6777	Following the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number – economic inequality is problematic.
1416	6778	A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced "distributive efficiency" within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility.
1416	6779	An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person.
1416	6780	Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person ("the additional dollar") decreases as a person becomes richer.
1416	6781	From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility.
1416	6782	Some studies have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.
1417	6783	Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption, rather than income should be the measure of inequality, and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the US.
1417	6784	Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute states that "the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality," and consumption is more important than income.
1417	6785	According to Johnson, Smeeding, and Tory, consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986.
1417	6786	The debate is summarized in "The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor" by journalist Thomas B. Edsall.
1417	6787	Other studies have not found consumption inequality less dramatic than household income inequality, and the CBO's study found consumption data not "adequately" capturing "consumption by high-income households" as it does their income, though it did agree that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution than household income.
1418	6788	Central Banking economist Raghuram Rajan argues that "systematic economic inequalities, within the United States and around the world, have created deep financial 'fault lines' that have made [financial] crises more likely to happen than in the past" – the Financial crisis of 2007–08 being the most recent example.
1418	6789	To compensate for stagnating and declining purchasing power, political pressure has developed to extend easier credit to the lower and middle income earners – particularly to buy homes – and easier credit in general to keep unemployment rates low.
1418	6790	This has given the American economy a tendency to go "from bubble to bubble" fueled by unsustainable monetary stimulation.
1419	6791	According to International Monetary Fund economists, inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells (not the rate of growth).
1419	6792	High levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity, but also the quality of a country's institutions and high levels of education.
1419	6793	According to IMF staff economists, "if the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down.
1419	6794	In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth.
1419	6795	The poor and the middle class matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic, social, and political channels."
1420	6796	According to economists David Castells-Quintana and Vicente Royuela, increasing inequality harms economic growth.
1420	6797	High and persistent unemployment, in which inequality increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth.
1420	6798	Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict.
1420	6799	Policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth.
1421	6800	Economist Joseph Stiglitz presented evidence in 2009 that both global inequality and inequality within countries prevent growth by limiting aggregate demand.
1421	6801	Economist Branko Milanovic, wrote in 2001 that, "The view that income inequality harms growth – or that improved equality can help sustain growth – has become more widely held in recent years.
1421	6802	The main reason for this shift is the increasing importance of human capital in development.
1421	6803	When physical capital mattered most, savings and investments were key.
1421	6804	Then it was important to have a large contingent of rich people who could save a greater proportion of their income than the poor and invest it in physical capital.
1421	6805	But now that human capital is scarcer than machines, widespread education has become the secret to growth."
1422	6806	In 1993, Galor and Zeira showed that inequality in the presence of credit market imperfections has a long lasting detrimental effect on human capital formation and economic development.
1422	6807	A 1996 study by Perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth.
1422	6808	He showed that, in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, and apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, and thereby lower levels of growth.
1422	6809	He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment.
1422	6810	Perotti concluded that, "more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education.
1422	6811	Both are reflected in higher rates of growth.
1422	6812	Also, very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable, which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth."
1423	6813	Research by Harvard economist Robert Barro, found that there is "little overall relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment".
1423	6814	According to work by Barro in 1999 and 2000, high levels of inequality reduce growth in relatively poor countries but encourage growth in richer countries.
1423	6815	A study of Swedish counties between 1960 and 2000 found a positive impact of inequality on growth with lead times of five years or less, but no correlation after ten years.
1423	6816	Studies of larger data sets have found no correlations for any fixed lead time, and a negative impact on the duration of growth.
1424	6817	Studies on income inequality and growth have sometimes found evidence confirming the Kuznets curve hypothesis, which states that with economic development, inequality first increases, then decreases.
1424	6818	Economist Thomas Piketty challenges this notion, claiming that from 1914 to 1945 wars and "violent economic and political shocks" reduced inequality.
1424	6819	Moreover, Piketty argues that the "magical" Kuznets curve hypothesis, with its emphasis on the balancing of economic growth in the long run, cannot account for the significant increase in economic inequality throughout the developed world since the 1970s.
1425	6820	Some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development.
1425	6821	According to a 1955 review, savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced consumer demand.
1425	6822	A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality.
1425	6823	Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development.
1425	6824	Analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth.
1425	6825	IMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth.
1425	6826	Developing countries with high inequality have "succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years" but "longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution."
1426	6827	While acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development, poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth.
1426	6828	The effect of economic growth on poverty reduction – the growth elasticity of poverty – can depend on the existing level of inequality.
1426	6829	For instance, with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2% per head and 40% of its population living in poverty, can halve poverty in ten years, but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction.
1426	6830	In the words of the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon: "While economic growth is necessary, it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty."
1427	6831	In many poor and developing countries much land and housing is held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system.
1427	6832	Much unregistered property is held in informal form through various associations and other arrangements.
1427	6833	Reasons for extra-legal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape in buying property and building, In some countries it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to build on government land.
1427	6834	Other causes of extra-legal property are failures to notarize transaction documents or having documents notarized but failing to have them recorded with the official agency.
1428	6835	A number of researchers (David Rodda, Jacob Vigdor, and Janna Matlack), argue that a shortage of affordable housing – at least in the US – is caused in part by income inequality.
1428	6836	David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased (Rhoda 1994:148).
1428	6837	Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units.
1428	6838	The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.
1429	6839	Firstly, certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, education and health care.
1429	6840	If the state does not provide these services, then for those on lower incomes, the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those who are worse equipped to manage their finances.
1429	6841	Secondly, aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt.
1429	6842	The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.
1430	6843	The smaller the economic inequality, the more waste and pollution is created, resulting in many cases, in more environmental degradation.
1430	6844	This can be explained by the fact that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy, it increases their yearly carbon emissions.
1430	6845	This relation is expressed by the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC).
1430	6846	[not in citation given] It should be noted here however that in certain cases, with great economic inequality, there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards (water treatment, filtering, ...).... Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier.
1430	6847	If there were fewer people however, this multiplier would be lower, and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well.
1430	6848	As such, the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well.
1430	6849	If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level (1/3 of current levels, so about 2 billion people), human inequality can be addressed/corrected, while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage.
1431	6850	Socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners, creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment, financial assets and corporate stock.
1431	6851	By contrast, the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary.
1431	6852	In order to rectify this situation, socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product.
1432	6853	Robert Nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force (usually in the form of taxation), and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force.
1432	6854	However, Nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property, and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves.
1432	6855	John Rawls argued in A Theory of Justice that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole, including the poorest members.
1432	6856	Rawls does not discuss the full implications of his theory of justice.
1432	6857	Some see Rawls's argument as a justification for capitalism since even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism; others believe only a strong welfare state can satisfy Rawls's theory of justice.
1433	6858	The capabilities approach – sometimes called the human development approach – looks at income inequality and poverty as form of “capability deprivation”.
1433	6859	Unlike neoliberalism, which “defines well-being as utility maximization”, economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself.
1433	6860	Its goal is to “wid[en] people’s choices and the level of their achieved well-being” through increasing functionings (the things a person values doing), capabilities (the freedom to enjoy functionings) and agency (the ability to pursue valued goals).
1434	6861	When a person’s capabilities are lowered, they are in some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise.
1434	6862	An old, ill man cannot earn as much as a healthy young man; gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home.
1434	6863	There may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic, or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives.
1434	6864	As a result, income and economic inequality increases, and it becomes more difficult to reduce the gap without additional aid.
1434	6865	To prevent such inequality, this approach believes it’s important to have political freedom, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security to ensure that people aren’t denied their functionings, capabilities, and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income.
1435	6866	Doctor Who is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC since 1963.
1435	6867	The programme depicts the adventures of the Doctor, a Time Lord—a space and time-travelling humanoid alien.
1435	6868	He explores the universe in his TARDIS, a sentient time-travelling space ship.
1435	6869	Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired.
1435	6870	Accompanied by companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes, while working to save civilisations and help people in need.
1436	6871	The show is a significant part of British popular culture, and elsewhere it has become a cult television favourite.
1436	6872	The show has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series.
1436	6873	The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989.
1436	6874	There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot, in the form of a television film.
1436	6875	The programme was relaunched in 2005 by Russell T Davies, who was showrunner and head writer for the first five years of its revival, produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff.
1436	6876	The first series of the 21st century featured Christopher Eccleston in the title role and was produced by the BBC.
1436	6877	Doctor Who also spawned spin-offs in multiple media, including Torchwood (2006–2011) and The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007–2011), both created by Russell T Davies; K-9 (2009–2010); and a single pilot episode of K-9 and Company (1981).
1436	6878	There also have been many spoofs and cultural references to the character in other media.
1437	6879	Twelve actors have headlined the series as the Doctor.
1437	6880	The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show, as well as the differing approach to the role that each brings, under the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation.
1437	6881	The show's premise is that this is a life process of Time Lords through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality, which occurs after sustaining an injury which would be fatal to most other species.
1437	6882	Each actor's portrayal differs, but they are all intended to be aspects of the same character and form part of the same storyline.
1437	6883	The time-travelling nature of the plot means that, on occasion, different Doctors have met each other.
1437	6884	Peter Capaldi took on the role after Matt Smith's exit in the 2013 Christmas special "The Time of the Doctor".
1438	6885	Doctor Who follows the adventures of the primary character, a rogue Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who simply goes by the name "The Doctor".
1438	6886	He fled from Gallifrey in a stolen Mark I Type 40 TARDIS – "Time and Relative Dimension in Space" – time machine which allows him to travel across time and space.
1438	6887	The TARDIS has a "chameleon circuit" which normally allows the machine to take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise.
1438	6888	However, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British Police box due to a malfunction in the chameleon circuit.
1439	6889	The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more companions to share these adventures.
1439	6890	His companions are usually humans, as he has found a fascination with planet Earth.
1439	6891	He often finds events that pique his curiosity as he tries to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only his ingenuity and minimal resources, such as his versatile sonic screwdriver.
1439	6892	As a Time Lord, the Doctor has the ability to regenerate when his body is mortally damaged, taking on a new appearance and personality.
1439	6893	The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during his travels, including the Daleks, the Cybermen, and the Master, another renegade Time Lord.
1440	6894	Doctor Who first appeared on BBC TV at 17:16:20 GMT, eighty seconds after the scheduled programme time, 5:15 pm, on Saturday, 23 November 1963.
1440	6895	It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length.
1440	6896	Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year.
1440	6897	The head of drama, Canadian Sydney Newman, was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber.
1440	6898	Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.
1440	6899	[note 1] The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience, as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history.
1440	6900	On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants.
1440	6901	As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors.
1440	6902	When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any "bug-eyed monsters".
1440	6903	The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, but The Mutants was the only script ready to go, so the show had little choice but to use it.
1440	6904	According to producer Verity Lambert; "We didn't have a lot of choice — we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it.
1440	6905	Had we had anything else ready we would have made that."
1440	6906	Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial – The Daleks (a.k.a.
1440	6907	The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.
1441	6908	The BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on BBC 1.
1441	6909	Falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less-prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC 1.
1441	6910	Although (as series co-star Sophie Aldred reported in the documentary Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS) it was effectively, if not formally, cancelled with the decision not to commission a planned 27th series of the show for transmission in 1990, the BBC repeatedly affirmed that the series would return.
1442	6911	While in-house production had ceased, the BBC hoped to find an independent production company to relaunch the show.
1442	6912	Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for Columbia Pictures' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th series was still in production.
1442	6913	Segal's negotiations eventually led to a Doctor Who television film, broadcast on the Fox Network in 1996 as a co-production between Fox, Universal Pictures, the BBC and BBC Worldwide.
1442	6914	Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1 million viewers), it was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series.
1443	6915	Doctor Who finally returned with the episode "Rose" on BBC One on 26 March 2005.
1443	6916	There have since been nine further series in 2006–2008 and 2010–2015, and Christmas Day specials every year since 2005.
1443	6917	No full series was filmed in 2009, although four additional specials starring David Tennant were made.
1443	6918	In 2010, Steven Moffat replaced Davies as head writer and executive producer.
1443	6919	In January 2016, Moffat announced that he would step down after the 2017 finale, to be replaced by Chris Chibnall in 2018.
1443	6920	In addition, Series 10 will debut in Spring 2017, with a Christmas special broadcast in 2016.
1444	6921	The 2005 version of Doctor Who is a direct plot continuation of the original 1963–1989 series[note 2] and the 1996 telefilm.
1444	6922	This is similar to the 1988 continuation of Mission Impossible, but differs from most other series relaunches which have either been reboots (for example, Battlestar Galactica and Bionic Woman[citation needed]) or set in the same universe as the original but in a different time period and with different characters (for example, Star Trek: The Next Generation and spin-offs[citation needed]).
1445	6923	It has been claimed that the transmission of the first episode was delayed by ten minutes due to extended news coverage of the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy the previous day; whereas in fact it went out after a delay of eighty seconds.
1445	6924	The BBC believed that many viewers had missed this introduction to a new series due to the coverage of the assassination, as well as a series of power blackouts across the country, and they broadcast it again on 30 November 1963, just before episode two.
1446	6925	The phrase "Hiding behind (or 'watching from behind') the sofa" entered British pop culture, signifying in humour the stereotypical early-series behaviour of children who wanted to avoid seeing frightening parts of a television programme while remaining in the room to watch the remainder of it.
1446	6926	The phrase retains this association with Doctor Who, to the point that in 1991 the Museum of the Moving Image in London named their exhibition celebrating the programme "Behind the Sofa".
1446	6927	The electronic theme music too was perceived as eerie, novel, and frightening, at the time.
1446	6928	A 2012 article placed this childhood juxtaposition of fear and thrill "at the center of many people's relationship with the show", and a 2011 online vote at Digital Spy deemed the series the "scariest TV show of all time".
1447	6929	A BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that, by their own definition of violence ("any act[s] which may cause physical and/or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental") Doctor Who was the most violent of the drama programmes the corporation produced at the time.
1447	6930	The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience regarded the show as "very unsuitable" for family viewing.
1447	6931	Responding to the findings of the survey in The Times newspaper, journalist Philip Howard maintained that, "to compare the violence of Dr Who, sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing Monopoly with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously."
1448	6932	The image of the TARDIS has become firmly linked to the show in the public's consciousness; BBC scriptwriter Anthony Coburn, who lived in the resort of Herne Bay, Kent, was one of the people who conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine.
1448	6933	In 1996, the BBC applied for a trade mark to use the TARDIS' blue police box design in merchandising associated with Doctor Who.
1448	6934	In 1998, the Metropolitan Police Authority filed an objection to the trade mark claim; but in 2002, the Patent Office ruled in favour of the BBC.
1449	6935	Doctor Who originally ran for 26 seasons on BBC One, from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989.
1449	6936	During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story (or "serial") — usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years.
1449	6937	Notable exceptions were: The Daleks' Master Plan, which aired in 12 episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, "Mission to the Unknown", featuring none of the regular cast); almost an entire season of seven-episode serials (season 7); the 10-episode serial The War Games; and The Trial of a Time Lord, which ran for 14 episodes (albeit divided into three production codes and four narrative segments) during season 23.
1449	6938	Occasionally serials were loosely connected by a storyline, such as season 8 being devoted to the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called The Master, season 16's quest for The Key to Time, season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, and season 20's Black Guardian Trilogy.
1450	6939	The serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with each series usually consisting of 13 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts, on overseas commercial channels), and an extended episode broadcast on Christmas Day.
1450	6940	Each series includes several standalone and multi-part stories, linked with a loose story arc that resolves in the series finale.
1450	6941	As in the early "classic" era, each episode, whether standalone or part of a larger story, has its own title.
1450	6942	Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes "Journey's End" from 2008 and "The Eleventh Hour" from 2010 exceeded an hour in length.
1451	6943	826 Doctor Who instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging between 25-minute episodes (the most common format), 45-minute episodes (for Resurrection of the Daleks in the 1984 series, a single season in 1985, and the revival), two feature-length productions (1983's The Five Doctors and the 1996 television film), eight Christmas specials (most of 60 minutes' duration, one of 72 minutes), and four additional specials ranging from 60 to 75 minutes in 2009, 2010 and 2013.
1451	6944	Four mini-episodes, running about eight minutes each, were also produced for the 1993, 2005 and 2007 Children in Need charity appeals, while another mini-episode was produced in 2008 for a Doctor Who-themed edition of The Proms.
1451	6945	The 1993 2-part story, entitled Dimensions in Time, was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera EastEnders and was filmed partly on the EastEnders set.
1451	6946	A two-part mini-episode was also produced for the 2011 edition of Comic Relief.
1451	6947	Starting with the 2009 special "Planet of the Dead", the series was filmed in 1080i for HDTV, and broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD.
1452	6948	Between about 1964 and 1973, large amounts of older material stored in the BBC's various video tape and film libraries were either destroyed,[note 3] wiped, or suffered from poor storage which led to severe deterioration from broadcast quality.
1452	6949	This included many old episodes of Doctor Who, mostly stories featuring the first two Doctors: William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton.
1452	6950	In all, 97 of 253 episodes produced during the first six years of the programme are not held in the BBC's archives (most notably seasons 3, 4, & 5, from which 79 episodes are missing).
1452	6951	In 1972, almost all episodes then made were known to exist at the BBC, while by 1978 the practice of wiping tapes and destroying "spare" film copies had been brought to a stop.
1453	6952	Some episodes have been returned to the BBC from the archives of other countries who bought prints for broadcast, or by private individuals who acquired them by various means.
1453	6953	Early colour videotape recordings made off-air by fans have also been retrieved, as well as excerpts filmed from the television screen onto 8 mm cine film and clips that were shown on other programmes.
1453	6954	Audio versions of all of the lost episodes exist from home viewers who made tape recordings of the show.
1453	6955	Short clips from every story with the exception of Marco Polo, "Mission to the Unknown" and The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve also exist.
1454	6956	"Official" reconstructions have also been released by the BBC on VHS, on MP3 CD-ROM, and as special features on DVD.
1454	6957	The BBC, in conjunction with animation studio Cosgrove Hall, reconstructed the missing episodes 1 and 4 of The Invasion (1968), using remastered audio tracks and the comprehensive stage notes for the original filming, for the serial's DVD release in November 2006.
1454	6958	The missing episodes of The Reign of Terror were animated by animation company Theta-Sigma, in collaboration with Big Finish, and became available for purchase in May 2013 through Amazon.com.
1454	6959	Subsequent animations made in 2013 include The Tenth Planet, The Ice Warriors and The Moonbase.
1455	6960	Producers introduced the concept of regeneration to permit the recasting of the main character.
1455	6961	This was first prompted by original star William Hartnell's poor health.
1455	6962	The actual term "regeneration" was not initially conceived of until the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration however; Hartnell's Doctor had merely described undergoing a "renewal," and the Second Doctor underwent a "change of appearance".
1455	6963	[citation needed] The device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show's history, as well as the depiction of alternative Doctors either from the Doctor's relative past or future.
1456	6964	The serials The Deadly Assassin and Mawdryn Undead and the 1996 TV film would later establish that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations.
1456	6965	This line became stuck in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time.
1456	6966	The episode "The Time of the Doctor" depicted the Doctor acquiring a new cycle of regenerations, starting from the Twelfth Doctor, due to the Eleventh Doctor being the product of the Doctor's twelfth regeneration from his original set.
1457	6967	In addition to those actors who have headlined the series, others have portrayed versions of the Doctor in guest roles.
1457	6968	Notably, in 2013, John Hurt guest-starred as a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the War Doctor in the run-up to the show's 50th anniversary special "The Day of the Doctor".
1457	6969	He is shown in mini-episode "The Night of the Doctor" to have been retroactively inserted into the show's fictional chronology between McGann and Eccleston's Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors.
1457	6970	Another example is from the 1986 serial The Trial of a Time Lord, where Michael Jayston portrayed the Valeyard, who is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between his twelfth and final incarnation.
1458	6971	There have been instances of actors returning at later dates to reprise the role of their specific Doctor.
1458	6972	In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee.
1458	6973	For 1983's The Five Doctors, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada episode.
1458	6974	For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell.
1458	6975	Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker.
1458	6976	In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short "Time Crash" alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, "The Day of the Doctor", David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.
1458	6977	In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past.
1458	6978	The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story Day of the Daleks, the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story Logopolis, the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in "Father's Day", and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in "The Big Bang".
1458	6979	In "The Almost People" the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica.
1458	6980	In "The Name of the Doctor", the Eleventh Doctor meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as "his secret" and who is subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor.
1459	6981	Additionally, multiple Doctors have returned in new adventures together in audio dramas based on the series.
1459	6982	Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy appeared together in the 1999 audio adventure The Sirens of Time.
1459	6983	To celebrate the 40th anniversary in 2003, an audio drama titled Zagreus featuring Paul McGann, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Peter Davison was released with additional archive recordings of Jon Pertwee.
1459	6984	Again in 2003, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy appeared together in the audio adventure Project: Lazarus.
1459	6985	In 2010, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann came together again to star in the audio drama The Four Doctors.
1460	6986	Throughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions.
1460	6987	In The Brain of Morbius (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor may not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted may have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius).
1460	6988	In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor.
1460	6989	In Mawdryn Undead (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation.
1460	6990	Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special The Five Doctors, the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms "Fourth", the First Doctor excitedly replies "Goodness me.
1460	6991	So there are five of me now."
1460	6992	In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself "the Eleventh" in "The Lodger".
1460	6993	In the 2013 episode "The Time of the Doctor," the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration.
1460	6994	The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied "Fall of the Eleventh" which had been trailed throughout the series.
1461	6995	The programme's first serial, An Unearthly Child, shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, Susan Foreman.
1461	6996	In the 1967 serial, Tomb of the Cybermen, when Victoria Waterfield doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, "being so ancient", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to—"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind".
1461	6997	The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in "The Empty Child" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, "Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather.
1461	6998	The Doctor remarks in response, "Yeah, I know the feeling."
1461	6999	In "Smith and Jones" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, "No, not any more."
1461	7000	In both "Fear Her" (2006) and "The Doctor's Daughter" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.
1462	7001	The companion figure – generally a human – has been a constant feature in Doctor Who since the programme's inception in 1963.
1462	7002	One of the roles of the companion is to remind the Doctor of his "moral duty".
1462	7003	The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell).
1462	7004	These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.
1462	7005	The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin.
1462	7006	Notable companions from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning).
1462	7007	Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve.
1462	7008	The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes — or loves — on worlds they have visited.
1462	7009	Some have died during the course of the series.
1462	7010	Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.
1463	7011	Since the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role.
1463	7012	Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor.
1463	7013	The primary companions of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors were Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) with Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) recurring as secondary companion figures.
1463	7014	The Eleventh Doctor became the first to travel with a married couple, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), whilst out-of-sync meetings with River Song (Alex Kingston) and Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) provided ongoing story arcs.
1463	7015	The tenth series will introduce Pearl Mackie as Bill, the Doctor's newest traveling companion.
1464	7016	With the show's 2005 revival, executive producer Russell T Davies stated his intention to reintroduce classic icons of Doctor Who one step at a time: the Autons with the Nestene Consciousness and Daleks in series 1, Cybermen in series 2, the Macra and the Master in series 3, the Sontarans and Davros in series 4, and the Time Lords (Rassilon) in the 2009–10 Specials.
1464	7017	Davies' successor, Steven Moffat, has continued the trend by reviving the Silurians in series 5, Cybermats in series 6, the Great Intelligence and the Ice Warriors in Series 7, and Zygons in the 50th Anniversary Special.
1464	7018	Since its 2005 return, the series has also introduced new recurring aliens: Slitheen (Raxacoricofallapatorian), Ood, Judoon, Weeping Angels and the Silence.
1465	7019	The Dalek race, which first appeared in the show's second serial in 1963, are Doctor Who's oldest villains.
1465	7020	The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility.
1465	7021	The actual creatures resemble octopi with large, pronounced brains.
1465	7022	Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon.
1465	7023	Their main weakness is their eyestalk; attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad.
1465	7024	Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to "exterminate" all non-Dalek beings.
1465	7025	They even attack the Time Lords in the Time War, as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show.
1465	7026	They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise, their most recent appearances being in the 2015 episodes "The Witch's Familiar" and "Hell Bent".
1465	7027	Davros has also been a recurring figure since his debut in Genesis of the Daleks, although played by several different actors.
1466	7028	The Master is the Doctor's archenemy, a renegade Time Lord who desires to rule the universe.
1466	7029	Conceived as "Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes", the character first appeared in 1971.
1466	7030	As with the Doctor, the role has been portrayed by several actors, since the Master is a Time Lord as well and able to regenerate; the first of these actors was Roger Delgado, who continued in the role until his death in 1973.
1466	7031	The Master was briefly played by Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers until Anthony Ainley took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Who's hiatus in 1989.
1466	7032	The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of Doctor Who, and was played by American actor Eric Roberts.
1467	7033	Following the series revival in 2005, Derek Jacobi provided the character's re-introduction in the 2007 episode "Utopia".
1467	7034	During that story the role was then assumed by John Simm who returned to the role multiple times through the Tenth Doctor's tenure.
1467	7035	As of the 2014 episode "Dark Water," it was revealed that the Master had become a female incarnation or "Time Lady," going by the name of "Missy" (short for Mistress, the feminine equivalent of "Master").
1467	7036	This incarnation is played by Michelle Gomez.
1468	7037	The original theme was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, with assistance from Dick Mills.
1468	7038	The various parts were built up using musique concrète techniques, by creating tape loops of an individually struck piano string and individual test oscillators and filters.
1468	7039	The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 (1979–80).
1468	7040	It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers.
1468	7041	Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music.
1468	7042	New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines.
1468	7043	On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, "Did I write that?
1469	7044	A different arrangement was recorded by Peter Howell for season 18 (1980), which was in turn replaced by Dominic Glynn's arrangement for the season-long serial The Trial of a Time Lord in season 23 (1986).
1469	7045	Keff McCulloch provided the new arrangement for the Seventh Doctor's era which lasted from season 24 (1987) until the series' suspension in 1989.
1469	7046	American composer John Debney created a new arrangement of Ron Grainer's original theme for Doctor Who in 1996.
1469	7047	For the return of the series in 2005, Murray Gold provided a new arrangement which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode "The Christmas Invasion", Gold introduced a modified closing credits arrangement that was used up until the conclusion of the 2007 series.
1470	7048	A new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, "Voyage of the Damned"; Gold returned as composer for the 2010 series.
1470	7049	He was responsible for a new version of the theme which was reported to have had a hostile reception from some viewers.
1470	7050	In 2011, the theme tune charted at number 228 of radio station Classic FM's Hall of Fame, a survey of classical music tastes.
1470	7051	A revised version of Gold's 2010 arrangement had its debut over the opening titles of the 2012 Christmas special "The Snowmen", and a further revision of the arrangement was made for the 50th Anniversary special "The Day of the Doctor" in November 2013.
1471	7052	Versions of the "Doctor Who Theme" have also been released as pop music over the years.
1471	7053	In the early 1970s, Jon Pertwee, who had played the Third Doctor, recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, "Who Is the Doctor".
1471	7054	[note 6] In 1978 a disco version of the theme was released in the UK, Denmark and Australia by the group Mankind, which reached number 24 in the UK charts.
1471	7055	In 1988 the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (later known as The KLF) released the single "Doctorin' the Tardis" under the name The Timelords, which reached No.
1471	7056	1 in the UK and No.
1471	7057	2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including "Rock and Roll Part 2" by Gary Glitter (who recorded vocals for some of the CD-single remix versions of "Doctorin' the Tardis").
1471	7058	Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include Orbital, Pink Floyd, the Australian string ensemble Fourplay, New Zealand punk band Blam Blam Blam, The Pogues, Thin Lizzy, Dub Syndicate, and the comedians Bill Bailey and Mitch Benn.
1471	7059	Both the theme and obsessive fans were satirised on The Chaser's War on Everything.
1471	7060	The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs, and has made its way into mobile-phone ringtones.
1471	7061	Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme.
1471	7062	In January 2011 the Mankind version was released as a digital download on the album Gallifrey And Beyond.
1472	7063	The most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was Dudley Simpson, who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for Blake's 7, and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of The Tomorrow People.
1472	7064	Simpson's first Doctor Who score was Planet of Giants (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with The Horns of Nimon (1979).
1472	7065	He also made a cameo appearance in The Talons of Weng-Chiang (as a Music hall conductor).
1473	7066	All the incidental music for the 2005 revived series has been composed by Murray Gold and Ben Foster and has been performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales from the 2005 Christmas episode "The Christmas Invasion" onwards.
1473	7067	A concert featuring the orchestra performing music from the first two series took place on 19 November 2006 to raise money for Children in Need.
1473	7068	David Tennant hosted the event, introducing the different sections of the concert.
1473	7069	Murray Gold and Russell T Davies answered questions during the interval and Daleks and Cybermen appeared whilst music from their stories was played.
1473	7070	The concert aired on BBCi on Christmas Day 2006.
1473	7071	A Doctor Who Prom was celebrated on 27 July 2008 in the Royal Albert Hall as part of the annual BBC Proms.
1473	7072	The BBC Philharmonic and the London Philharmonic Choir performed Murray Gold's compositions for the series, conducted by Ben Foster, as well as a selection of classics based on the theme of space and time.
1473	7073	The event was presented by Freema Agyeman and guest-presented by various other stars of the show with numerous monsters participating in the proceedings.
1473	7074	It also featured the specially filmed mini-episode "Music of the Spheres", written by Russell T Davies and starring David Tennant.
1474	7075	Six soundtrack releases have been released since 2005.
1474	7076	The first featured tracks from the first two series, the second and third featured music from the third and fourth series respectively.
1474	7077	The fourth was released on 4 October 2010 as a two disc special edition and contained music from the 2008–2010 specials (The Next Doctor to End of Time Part 2).
1474	7078	The soundtrack for Series 5 was released on 8 November 2010.
1474	7079	In February 2011, a soundtrack was released for the 2010 Christmas special: "A Christmas Carol", and in December 2011 the soundtrack for Series 6 was released, both by Silva Screen Records.
1475	7080	The original logo used for the First Doctor (and briefly for the Second Doctor) was reused in a slightly modified format for the 50th anniversary special "The Day of the Doctor" during the Eleventh Doctor's run.
1475	7081	The logo used in the television movie featuring the Eighth Doctor was an updated version of the logo used for the Third Doctor.
1475	7082	The logo from 1973–80 was used for the Third Doctor's final season and for the majority of the Fourth Doctor's tenure.
1475	7083	The following logo, while most associated with the Fifth Doctor, was also used for the Fourth Doctor's final season.
1475	7084	The logo used for the Ninth Doctor was slightly edited for the Tenth Doctor, but it retained the same general appearance.
1475	7085	The logo used for the Eleventh Doctor had the "DW" TARDIS insignia placed to the right in 2012, but the same font remained, albeit with a slight edit to the texture every episode, with the texture relating to some aspect of the story.
1475	7086	The logo for the Twelfth Doctor had the "DW" TARDIS insignia removed and the font was subtly altered, as well as made slightly larger.
1475	7087	As of 2014, the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors is the primary logo used on all media and merchandise relating to past Doctors, and the current Doctor Who logo is used for all merchandise relating to the current Doctor.
1476	7088	Premiering the day after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the first episode of Doctor Who was repeated with the second episode the following week.
1476	7089	Doctor Who has always appeared initially on the BBC's mainstream BBC One channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers; episodes are now repeated on BBC Three.
1476	7090	The programme's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings.
1476	7091	The first of these was the "Dalekmania" period (circa 1964–1965), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought Doctor Who ratings of between 9 and 14 million, even for stories which did not feature them.
1476	7092	The second was the late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12 million.
1477	7093	During the ITV network strike of 1979, viewership peaked at 16 million.
1477	7094	[citation needed] Figures remained respectable into the 1980s, but fell noticeably after the programme's 23rd series was postponed in 1985 and the show was off the air for 18 months.
1477	7095	Its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time and was, according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme's 1989 suspension.
1477	7096	Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the soap opera Coronation Street, the most popular show at the time.
1477	7097	After the series' revival in 2005 (the third notable period of high ratings), it has consistently had high viewership levels for the evening on which the episode is broadcast.
1478	7098	Only four episodes have ever had their premiere showings on channels other than BBC One.
1478	7099	The 1983 20th anniversary special The Five Doctors had its début on 23 November (the actual date of the anniversary) on a number of PBS stations two days prior to its BBC One broadcast.
1478	7100	The 1988 story Silver Nemesis was broadcast with all three episodes airing back to back on TVNZ in New Zealand in November, after the first episode had been shown in the UK but before the final two instalments had aired there.
1478	7101	Finally, the 1996 television film premièred on 12 May 1996 on CITV in Edmonton, Canada, 15 days before the BBC One showing, and two days before it aired on Fox in the United States.
1479	7102	In Australia, the show has had a strong fan base since its inception, having been exclusively first run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) since January 1965.
1479	7103	The ABC has periodically repeated episodes; of note were the weekly screenings of all available classic episodes starting in 2003, for the show's 40th anniversary, and the weekdaily screenings of all available revived episodes in 2013 for the show's 50th anniversary.
1479	7104	The ABC broadcasts the modern series first run on ABC1, with repeats on ABC2.
1479	7105	The ABC also provided partial funding for the 20th anniversary special The Five Doctors in 1983.
1479	7106	Repeats of both the classic and modern series have also been shown on subscription television channels BBC UKTV, SF and later on SyFy upon SF's closure.
1480	7107	TVOntario picked up the show in 1976 beginning with The Three Doctors and aired each series (several years late) through to series 24 in 1991.
1480	7108	From 1979 to 1981, TVO airings were bookended by science-fiction writer Judith Merril who would introduce the episode and then, after the episode concluded, try to place it in an educational context in keeping with TVO's status as an educational channel.
1480	7109	Its airing of The Talons of Weng-Chiang was cancelled as a result of accusations that the story was racist; the story was later broadcast in the 1990s on cable station YTV.
1480	7110	CBC began showing the series again in 2005.
1480	7111	The series moved to the Canadian cable channel Space in 2009.
1481	7112	For the Canadian broadcast, Christopher Eccleston recorded special video introductions for each episode (including a trivia question as part of a viewer contest) and excerpts from the Doctor Who Confidential documentary were played over the closing credits; for the broadcast of "The Christmas Invasion" on 26 December 2005, Billie Piper recorded a special video introduction.
1481	7113	CBC began airing series two on 9 October 2006 at 20:00 E/P (20:30 in Newfoundland and Labrador), shortly after that day's CFL double header on Thanksgiving in most of the country.
1482	7114	A wide selection of serials are available from BBC Video on DVD, on sale in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the United States.

1483	7121	Doctor Who has appeared on stage numerous times.
1483	7122	In the early 1970s, Trevor Martin played the role in Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday.
1483	7123	In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure.
1483	7124	For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks (better known for playing Cybermen) played the Doctor.
1483	7125	Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while Terry Nation wrote The Curse of the Daleks, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor.
1484	7126	Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled Torchwood (an anagram of "Doctor Who"), set in modern-day Cardiff and investigating alien activities and crime.
1484	7127	The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006.
1484	7128	John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of Doctor Who.

1484	7130	A second series of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones.
1484	7131	A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London.
1484	7132	A fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011.
1484	7133	The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting.

1485	7135	A second series followed in 2008, notable for (as noted above) featuring the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart.
1485	7136	A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor.
1485	7137	In 2010, a further such appearance featured Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress Katy Manning reprising her role as Jo Grant.
1485	7138	A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011 – uncompleted due to the death of Elisabeth Sladen in early 2011.
1486	7139	In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled Dimensions in Time was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions.
1486	7140	It also featured a crossover with the soap opera EastEnders, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich.
1486	7141	The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.
1487	7142	In 1999, another special, Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS.
1487	7143	An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes).
1487	7144	In the story, the Doctor (Rowan Atkinson) encounters both the Master (Jonathan Pryce) and the Daleks.
1487	7145	During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley.
1487	7146	The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.

1488	7149	In a similar manner, the character of Oliver on Coupling (created and written by current show runner Steven Moffat) is portrayed as a Doctor Who collector and enthusiast.
1488	7150	References to Doctor Who have also appeared in the young adult fantasy novels Brisingr and High Wizardry, the video game Rock Band, the soap opera EastEnders, the Adult Swim comedy show Robot Chicken, the Family Guy episodes "Blue Harvest" and "420", and the game RuneScape.
1488	7151	It has also be referenced in Destroy All Humans!
1488	7152	2, by civilians in the game's variation of England, and in Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney.
1489	7153	The earliest Doctor Who-related audio release was a 21-minute narrated abridgement of the First Doctor television story The Chase released in 1966.
1489	7154	Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on LP record; Doctor Who and the Pescatons featuring the Fourth Doctor.
1489	7155	The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story State of Decay in 1981.
1489	7156	In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, Slipback, the first radio drama, was transmitted.
1490	7157	Since 1999, Big Finish Productions has released several different series of Doctor Who audios on CD.

1491	7162	Doctor Who books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day.

1491	7166	This is published by Panini, as is the Doctor Who Adventures magazine for younger fans.
1492	7167	Since the creation of the Doctor Who character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about Doctor Who, in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and even stage performances.
1492	7168	In this respect it is noteworthy that the BBC takes no position on the canonicity of any of such stories, and producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea.
1493	7169	The show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies' tenure as executive producer.

1499	7194	Beyond the arts and sciences, Chicago is also well known for its professional schools, which include the Pritzker School of Medicine, the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, the Law School, the School of Social Service Administration, the Harris School of Public Policy Studies, the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies and the Divinity School.
1499	7195	The university currently enrolls approximately 5,000 students in the College and around 15,000 students overall.
1500	7196	University of Chicago scholars have played a major role in the development of various academic disciplines, including: the Chicago school of economics, the Chicago school of sociology, the law and economics movement in legal analysis, the Chicago school of literary criticism, the Chicago school of religion, and the behavioralism school of political science.
1500	7197	Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction beneath the university's Stagg Field.
1500	7198	Chicago's research pursuits have been aided by unique affiliations with world-renowned institutions like the nearby Fermilab and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory.
1500	7199	The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States.
1500	7200	With an estimated completion date of 2020, the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation.
1501	7201	Founded by the American Baptist Education Society with a donation from oil magnate and wealthiest man in history John D. Rockefeller, the University of Chicago was incorporated in 1890; William Rainey Harper became the university's first president in 1891, and the first classes were held in 1892.
1501	7202	Both Harper and future president Robert Maynard Hutchins advocated for Chicago's curriculum to be based upon theoretical and perennial issues rather than on applied sciences and commercial utility.
1501	7203	With Harper's vision in mind, the University of Chicago also became one of the 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities, an international organization of leading research universities, in 1900.
1502	7204	The University of Chicago was created and incorporated as a coeducational, secular institution in 1890 by the American Baptist Education Society and a donation from oil magnate and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller on land donated by Marshall Field.
1502	7205	While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long-term endowment, it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings.
1502	7206	The original physical campus was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans like Silas B. Cobb who provided the funds for the campus' first building, Cobb Lecture Hall, and matched Marshall Field's pledge of $100,000.
1502	7207	Other early benefactors included businessmen Charles L. Hutchinson (trustee, treasurer and donor of Hutchinson Commons), Martin A. Ryerson (president of the board of trustees and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory) Adolphus Clay Bartlett and Leon Mandel, who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall, and George C. Walker of the Walker Museum, a relative of Cobb who encouraged his inaugural donation for facilities.
1503	7208	In the 1890s, the University of Chicago, fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University.
1503	7209	In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois.
1503	7210	Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions.
1503	7211	The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago.
1503	7212	A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work.
1503	7213	The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost.
1503	7214	The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice.
1503	7215	Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university.
1503	7216	The program passed into history by 1910.
1504	7217	In 1929, the university's fifth president, Robert Maynard Hutchins, took office; the university underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure.
1504	7218	Hutchins eliminated varsity football from the university in an attempt to emphasize academics over athletics, instituted the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the Common Core, and organized the university's graduate work into its current[when?]
1504	7219	In 1933, Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago and Northwestern University into a single university.
1504	7220	During his term, the University of Chicago Hospitals (now called the University of Chicago Medical Center) finished construction and enrolled its first medical students.
1504	7221	Also, the Committee on Social Thought, an institution distinctive of the university, was created.
1505	7222	In the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood.
1505	7223	In response, the university became a major sponsor of a controversial urban renewal project for Hyde Park, which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan.
1505	7224	During this period the university, like Shimer College and 10 others, adopted an early entrant program that allowed very young students to attend college; in addition, students enrolled at Shimer were enabled to transfer automatically to the University of Chicago after their second year, having taken comparable or identical examinations and courses.
1506	7225	The university experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962, when students occupied President George Beadle's office in a protest over the university's off-campus rental policies.
1506	7226	After continued turmoil, a university committee in 1967 issued what became known as the Kalven Report.
1506	7227	The report, a two-page statement of the university's policy in "social and political action," declared that "To perform its mission in the society, a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions, passions, and pressures."
1506	7228	The report has since been used to justify decisions such as the university's refusal to divest from South Africa in the 1980s and Darfur in the late 2000s.
1507	7229	From the mid-2000s, the university began a number of multimillion-dollar expansion projects.
1507	7230	In 2008, the University of Chicago announced plans to establish the Milton Friedman Institute which attracted both support and controversy from faculty members and students.
1507	7231	The institute will cost around $200 million and occupy the buildings of the Chicago Theological Seminary.
1507	7232	During the same year, investor David G. Booth donated $300 million to the university's Booth School of Business, which is the largest gift in the university's history and the largest gift ever to any business school.
1507	7233	In 2009, planning or construction on several new buildings, half of which cost $100 million or more, was underway.
1507	7234	Since 2011, major construction projects have included the Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, a ten-story medical research center, and further additions to the medical campus of the University of Chicago Medical Center.
1507	7235	In 2014 the University launched the public phase of a $4.5 billion fundraising campaign.
1507	7236	In September 2015, the University received $100 million from The Pearson Family Foundation to establish The Pearson Institute for the Study and Resolution of Global Conflicts and The Pearson Global Forum at the Harris School of Public Policy Studies.
1508	7237	The first buildings of the University of Chicago campus, which make up what is now known as the Main Quadrangles, were part of a "master plan" conceived by two University of Chicago trustees and plotted by Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb.
1508	7238	The Main Quadrangles consist of six quadrangles, each surrounded by buildings, bordering one larger quadrangle.
1508	7239	The buildings of the Main Quadrangles were designed by Cobb, Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, Holabird & Roche, and other architectural firms in a mixture of the Victorian Gothic and Collegiate Gothic styles, patterned on the colleges of the University of Oxford.
1508	7240	(Mitchell Tower, for example, is modeled after Oxford's Magdalen Tower, and the university Commons, Hutchinson Hall, replicates Christ Church Hall.)
1509	7241	After the 1940s, the Gothic style on campus began to give way to modern styles.
1509	7242	Another master plan, designed in 1999 and updated in 2004, produced the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center (2003), the Max Palevsky Residential Commons (2001), South Campus Residence Hall and dining commons (2009), a new children's hospital, and other construction, expansions, and restorations.
1509	7243	In 2011, the university completed the glass dome-shaped Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, which provides a grand reading room for the university library and prevents the need for an off-campus book depository.
1510	7244	The University of Chicago also maintains facilities apart from its main campus.
1510	7245	The university's Booth School of Business maintains campuses in Singapore, London, and the downtown Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago.
1510	7246	The Center in Paris, a campus located on the left bank of the Seine in Paris, hosts various undergraduate and graduate study programs.
1510	7247	In fall 2010, the University of Chicago also opened a center in Beijing, near Renmin University's campus in Haidian District.
1510	7248	The most recent additions are a center in New Delhi, India, which opened in 2014, and a center in Hong Kong which opened in 2015.
1511	7249	The University of Chicago is governed by a board of trustees.

1536	7341	The Yuan dynasty (Chinese: 元朝; pinyin: Yuán Cháo), officially the Great Yuan (Chinese: 大元; pinyin: Dà Yuán; Mongolian: Yehe Yuan Ulus[a]), was the empire or ruling dynasty of China established by Kublai Khan, leader of the Mongolian Borjigin clan.
1536	7342	Although the Mongols had ruled territories including today's North China for decades, it was not until 1271 that Kublai Khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional Chinese style.
1536	7343	His realm was, by this point, isolated from the other khanates and controlled most of present-day China and its surrounding areas, including modern Mongolia and Korea.
1536	7344	It was the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368, after which its Genghisid rulers returned to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule the Northern Yuan dynasty.
1536	7345	Some of the Mongolian Emperors of the Yuan mastered the Chinese language, while others only used their native language (i.e.

1537	7348	In official Chinese histories, the Yuan dynasty bore the Mandate of Heaven, following the Song dynasty and preceding the Ming dynasty.
1537	7349	The dynasty was established by Kublai Khan, yet he placed his grandfather Genghis Khan on the imperial records as the official founder of the dynasty as Taizu.
1537	7350	[b] In the Proclamation of the Dynastic Name (《建國號詔》), Kublai announced the name of the new dynasty as Great Yuan and claimed the succession of former Chinese dynasties from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Tang dynasty.
1538	7351	In 1271, Kublai Khan imposed the name Great Yuan (Chinese: 大元; pinyin: Dà Yuán; Wade–Giles: Ta-Yüan), establishing the Yuan dynasty.
1538	7352	"Dà Yuán" (大元) is from the sentence "大哉乾元" (dà zai Qián Yuán / "Great is Qián, the Primal") in the Commentaries on the Classic of Changes (I Ching) section regarding Qián (乾).
1538	7353	The counterpart in Mongolian language was Dai Ön Ulus, also rendered as Ikh Yuan Üls or Yekhe Yuan Ulus.
1538	7354	In Mongolian, Dai Ön (Great Yuan) is often used in conjunction with the "Yeke Mongghul Ulus" (lit.
1538	7355	"Great Mongol State"), resulting in Dai Ön Yeke Mongghul Ulus (Mongolian script: ), meaning "Great Yuan Great Mongol State".
1538	7356	The Yuan dynasty is also known as the "Mongol dynasty" or "Mongol Dynasty of China", similar to the names "Manchu dynasty" or "Manchu Dynasty of China" for the Qing dynasty.
1538	7357	Furthermore, the Yuan is sometimes known as the "Empire of the Great Khan" or "Khanate of the Great Khan", which particularly appeared on some Yuan maps, since Yuan emperors held the nominal title of Great Khan.
1538	7358	Nevertheless, both terms can also refer to the khanate within the Mongol Empire directly ruled by Great Khans before the actual establishment of the Yuan dynasty by Kublai Khan in 1271.
1539	7359	Genghis Khan united the Mongol and Turkic tribes of the steppes and became Great Khan in 1206.
1539	7360	He and his successors expanded the Mongol empire across Asia.
1539	7361	Under the reign of Genghis' third son, Ögedei Khan, the Mongols destroyed the weakened Jin dynasty in 1234, conquering most of northern China.
1539	7362	Ögedei offered his nephew Kublai a position in Xingzhou, Hebei.
1539	7363	Kublai was unable to read Chinese but had several Han Chinese teachers attached to him since his early years by his mother Sorghaghtani.
1539	7364	He sought the counsel of Chinese Buddhist and Confucian advisers.
1539	7365	Möngke Khan succeeded Ögedei's son, Güyük, as Great Khan in 1251.
1539	7366	He granted his brother Kublai control over Mongol held territories in China.
1539	7367	Kublai built schools for Confucian scholars, issued paper money, revived Chinese rituals, and endorsed policies that stimulated agricultural and commercial growth.
1539	7368	He adopted as his capital city Kaiping in Inner Mongolia, later renamed Shangdu.
1540	7369	Many Han Chinese and Khitan defected to the Mongols to fight against the Jin.
1540	7370	Two Han Chinese leaders, Shi Tianze, Liu Heima (劉黑馬, Liu Ni), and the Khitan Xiao Zhala (蕭札剌) defected and commanded the 3 Tumens in the Mongol army.
1540	7371	Liu Heima and Shi Tianze served Ogödei Khan.
1540	7372	Liu Heima and Shi Tianxiang led armies against Western Xia for the Mongols.
1540	7373	There were 4 Han Tumens and 3 Khitan Tumens, with each Tumen consisting of 10,000 troops.
1540	7374	The three Khitan Generals Shimobeidier (石抹孛迭兒), Tabuyir (塔不已兒) and Xiaozhacizhizizhongxi (蕭札刺之子重喜) commanded the three Khitan Tumens and the four Han Generals Zhang Rou, Yan Shi, Shi Tianze, and Liu Heima commanded the four Han tumens under Ogödei Khan.
1541	7375	Shi Tianze was a Han Chinese who lived in the Jin dynasty.
1541	7376	Interethnic marriage between Han and Jurchen became common at this time.
1541	7377	His father was Shi Bingzhi (史秉直, Shih Ping-chih).
1541	7378	Shi Bingzhi was married to a Jurchen woman (surname Na-ho) and a Han Chinese woman (surname Chang); it is unknown which of them was Shi Tianze's mother.
1541	7379	Shi Tianze was married to two Jurchen women, a Han Chinese woman, and a Korean woman, and his son Shi Gang was born to one of his Jurchen wives.
1541	7380	The surnames of his Jurchen wives were Mo-nien and Na-ho; the surname of his Korean wife was Li; and the surname of his Han Chinese wife was Shi.
1541	7381	Shi Tianze defected to Mongol forces upon their invasion of the Jin dynasty.
1541	7382	His son Shi Gang married a Kerait woman; the Kerait were Mongolified Turkic people and were considered part of the "Mongol nation".
1541	7383	Shi Tianze (Shih T'ien-tse), Zhang Rou (Chang Jou, 張柔), and Yan Shi (Yen Shih, 嚴實) and other high ranking Chinese who served in the Jin dynasty and defected to the Mongols helped build the structure for the administration of the new state.
1541	7384	Chagaan (Tsagaan) and Zhang Rou jointly launched an attack on the Song dynasty ordered by Töregene Khatun.
1542	7385	Möngke Khan commenced a military campaign against the Chinese Song dynasty in southern China.
1542	7386	The Mongol force that invaded southern China was far greater than the force they sent to invade the Middle East in 1256.
1542	7387	He died in 1259 without a successor.
1542	7388	Kublai returned from fighting the Song in 1260 when he learned that his brother, Ariq Böke, was challenging his claim to the throne.
1542	7389	Kublai convened a kurultai in Kaiping that elected him Great Khan.
1542	7390	A rival kurultai in Mongolia proclaimed Ariq Böke Great Khan, beginning a civil war.
1542	7391	Kublai depended on the cooperation of his Chinese subjects to ensure that his army received ample resources.
1542	7392	He bolstered his popularity among his subjects by modeling his government on the bureaucracy of traditional Chinese dynasties and adopting the Chinese era name of Zhongtong.
1542	7393	Ariq Böke was hampered by inadequate supplies and surrendered in 1264.
1542	7394	All of the three western khanates (Golden Horde, Chagatai Khanate and Ilkhanate) became functionally autonomous, although only the Ilkhans truly recognized Kublai as Great Khan.
1542	7395	Civil strife had permanently divided the Mongol Empire.
1543	7396	Instability troubled the early years of Kublai Khan's reign.
1543	7397	Ogedei's grandson Kaidu refused to submit to Kublai and threatened the western frontier of Kublai's domain.
1543	7398	The hostile but weakened Song dynasty remained an obstacle in the south.
1543	7399	Kublai secured the northeast border in 1259 by installing the hostage prince Wonjong as the ruler of Korea, making it a Mongol tributary state.
1543	7400	Kublai was also threatened by domestic unrest.
1543	7401	Li Tan, the son-in-law of a powerful official, instigated a revolt against Mongol rule in 1262.
1543	7402	After successfully suppressing the revolt, Kublai curbed the influence of the Han Chinese advisers in his court.
1543	7403	He feared that his dependence on Chinese officials left him vulnerable to future revolts and defections to the Song.
1544	7404	Kublai's government after 1262 was a compromise between preserving Mongol interests in China and satisfying the demands of his Chinese subjects.
1544	7405	He instituted the reforms proposed by his Chinese advisers by centralizing the bureaucracy, expanding the circulation of paper money, and maintaining the traditional monopolies on salt and iron.
1544	7406	He restored the Imperial Secretariat and left the local administrative structure of past Chinese dynasties unchanged.
1544	7407	However, Kublai rejected plans to revive the Confucian imperial examinations and divided Yuan society into three, later four, classes with the Han Chinese occupying the lowest rank.
1544	7408	Kublai's Chinese advisers still wielded significant power in the government, but their official rank was nebulous.
1545	7409	Kublai readied the move of the Mongol capital from Karakorum in Mongolia to Khanbaliq in 1264, constructing a new city near the former Jurchen capital Zhongdu, now modern Beijing, in 1266.
1545	7410	In 1271, Kublai formally claimed the Mandate of Heaven and declared that 1272 was the first year of the Great Yuan (Chinese: 大元) in the style of a traditional Chinese dynasty.
1545	7411	The name of the dynasty originated from the I Ching and describes the "origin of the universe" or a "primal force".
1545	7412	Kublai proclaimed Khanbaliq the "Great Capital" or Daidu (Dadu, Chinese: 大都 in Chinese) of the dynasty.
1545	7413	The era name was changed to Zhiyuan to herald a new era of Chinese history.
1545	7414	The adoption of a dynastic name legitimized Mongol rule by integrating the government into the narrative of traditional Chinese political succession.
1545	7415	Khublai evoked his public image as a sage emperor by following the rituals of Confucian propriety and ancestor veneration, while simultaneously retaining his roots as a leader from the steppes.
1546	7416	Kublai Khan promoted commercial, scientific, and cultural growth.
1546	7417	He supported the merchants of the Silk Road trade network by protecting the Mongol postal system, constructing infrastructure, providing loans that financed trade caravans, and encouraging the circulation of paper banknotes (鈔, Chao).
1546	7418	Pax Mongolica, Mongol peace, enabled the spread of technologies, commodities, and culture between China and the West.
1546	7419	Kublai expanded the Grand Canal from southern China to Daidu in the north.
1546	7420	Mongol rule was cosmopolitan under Kublai Khan.
1546	7421	He welcomed foreign visitors to his court, such as the Venetian merchant Marco Polo, who wrote the most influential European account of Yuan China.
1546	7422	Marco Polo's travels would later inspire many others like Christopher Columbus to chart a passage to the Far East in search of its legendary wealth.
1547	7423	During the Southern Song dynasty the descendant of Confucius at Qufu, the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou, while the newly established Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng.
1547	7424	From that time up until the Yuan dynasty, there were two Duke Yanshengs, once in the north in Qufu and the other in the south at Quzhou.
1547	7425	During the Yuan dynasty, the Emperor Kublai Khan invited the southern Duke Yansheng Kong Zhu to return to Qufu.
1547	7426	Kong Zhu refused, and gave up the title, so the northern branch of the family kept the title of Duke Yansheng.
1547	7427	The southern branch still remained in Quzhou where they lived to this day.
1547	7428	Confucius's descendants in Quzhou alone number 30,000.
1547	7429	During the Yuan dynasty, one of Confucius' descendants moved from China to Goryeo era Korea and established a branch of the family there after marrying a Korean woman.
1548	7430	After strengthening his government in northern China, Kublai pursued an expansionist policy in line with the tradition of Mongol and Chinese imperialism.
1548	7431	He renewed a massive drive against the Song dynasty to the south.
1548	7432	Kublai besieged Xiangyang between 1268 and 1273, the last obstacle in his way to capture the rich Yangzi River basin.
1548	7433	An unsuccessful naval expedition was undertaken against Japan in 1274.
1548	7434	Kublai captured the Song capital of Hangzhou in 1276, the wealthiest city of China.
1548	7435	Song loyalists escaped from the capital and enthroned a young child as Emperor Bing of Song.
1548	7436	The Mongols defeated the loyalists at the battle of Yamen in 1279.
1548	7437	The last Song emperor drowned, bringing an end to the Song dynasty.
1548	7438	The conquest of the Song reunited northern and southern China for the first time in three hundred years.
1549	7439	Kublai's government faced financial difficulties after 1279.
1549	7440	Wars and construction projects had drained the Mongol treasury.
1549	7441	Efforts to raise and collect tax revenues were plagued by corruption and political scandals.
1549	7442	Mishandled military expeditions followed the financial problems.
1549	7443	Kublai's second invasion of Japan in 1281 failed because of an inauspicious typhoon.
1549	7444	Kublai botched his campaigns against Annam, Champa, and Java, but won a Pyrrhic victory against Burma.
1549	7445	The expeditions were hampered by disease, an inhospitable climate, and a tropical terrain unsuitable for the mounted warfare of the Mongols.
1549	7446	The Tran dynasty which ruled Annam (Dai Viet) crushed and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Bạch Đằng (1288).
1549	7447	The Chinese region of Fujian was the original home of the Chinese Tran (Chen) clan before they migrated under Trần Kinh (陳京, Chén Jīng) to Dai Viet and whose descendants established the Trần dynasty which ruled Vietnam Đại Việt, and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese such as when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Trần prince Trần Quốc Tuấn (later King Trần Hưng Đạo) in 1282.
1549	7448	Professor Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao fled to Tran dynasty ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song and they helped the Tran fight against the Mongol invasion.
1549	7449	The Tran dynasty originated from the Fujian region of China as did the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as "Northern bandits".
1549	7450	Annam, Burma, and Champa recognized Mongol hegemony and established tributary relations with the Yuan dynasty.
1550	7451	Following the conquest of Dali in 1253, the former ruling Duan dynasty were appointed as governors-general, recognized as imperial officials by the Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era governments, principally in the province of Yunnan.
1550	7452	Succession for the Yuan dynasty, however, was an intractable problem, later causing much strife and internal struggle.
1550	7453	This emerged as early as the end of Kublai's reign.
1550	7454	Kublai originally named his eldest son, Zhenjin, as the Crown Prince, but he died before Kublai in 1285.
1550	7455	Thus, Zhenjin's third son, with the support of his mother Kökejin and the minister Bayan, succeeded the throne and ruled as Temür Khan, or Emperor Chengzong, from 1294 to 1307.
1550	7456	Temür Khan decided to maintain and continue much of the work begun by his grandfather.
1550	7457	He also made peace with the western Mongol khanates as well as neighboring countries such as Vietnam, which recognized his nominal suzerainty and paid tributes for a few decades.
1550	7458	However, the corruption in the Yuan dynasty began during the reign of Temür Khan.
1551	7459	The fourth Yuan emperor, Buyantu Khan (Ayurbarwada), was a competent emperor.
1551	7460	He was the first Yuan emperor to actively support and adopt mainstream Chinese culture after the reign of Kublai, to the discontent of some Mongol elite.
1551	7461	He had been mentored by Li Meng, a Confucian academic.
1551	7462	He made many reforms, including the liquidation of the Department of State Affairs (Chinese: 尚書省), which resulted in the execution of five of the highest-ranking officials.
1551	7463	Starting in 1313 the traditional imperial examinations were reintroduced for prospective officials, testing their knowledge on significant historical works.
1551	7464	Also, he codified much of the law, as well as publishing or translating a number of Chinese books and works.
1552	7465	Emperor Gegeen Khan, Ayurbarwada's son and successor, ruled for only two years, from 1321 to 1323.
1552	7466	He continued his father's policies to reform the government based on the Confucian principles, with the help of his newly appointed grand chancellor Baiju.
1552	7467	During his reign, the Da Yuan Tong Zhi (Chinese: 大元通制, "the comprehensive institutions of the Great Yuan"), a huge collection of codes and regulations of the Yuan dynasty begun by his father, was formally promulgated.
1552	7468	Gegeen was assassinated in a coup involving five princes from a rival faction, perhaps steppe elite opposed to Confucian reforms.
1552	7469	They placed Yesün Temür (or Taidingdi) on the throne, and, after an unsuccessful attempt to calm the princes, he also succumbed to regicide.
1553	7470	When Yesün Temür died in Shangdu in 1328, Tugh Temür was recalled to Khanbaliq by the Qipchaq commander El Temür.
1553	7471	He was installed as the emperor (Emperor Wenzong) in Khanbaliq, while Yesün Temür's son Ragibagh succeeded to the throne in Shangdu with the support of Yesün Temür's favorite retainer Dawlat Shah.
1553	7472	Gaining support from princes and officers in Northern China and some other parts of the dynasty, Khanbaliq-based Tugh Temür eventually won the civil war against Ragibagh known as the War of the Two Capitals.
1553	7473	Afterwards, Tugh Temür abdicated in favour of his brother Kusala, who was backed by Chagatai Khan Eljigidey, and announced Khanbaliq's intent to welcome him.
1553	7474	However, Kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with Tugh Temür.
1553	7475	He was supposedly killed with poison by El Temür, and Tugh Temür then remounted the throne.
1553	7476	Tugh Temür also managed to send delegates to the western Mongol khanates such as Golden Horde and Ilkhanate to be accepted as the suzerain of Mongol world.
1553	7477	However, he was mainly a puppet of the powerful official El Temür during his latter three-year reign.
1553	7478	El Temür purged pro-Kusala officials and brought power to warlords, whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the dynasty.
1554	7479	Due to the fact that the bureaucracy was dominated by El Temür, Tugh Temür is known for his cultural contribution instead.
1554	7480	He adopted many measures honoring Confucianism and promoting Chinese cultural values.
1554	7481	His most concrete effort to patronize Chinese learning was founding the Academy of the Pavilion of the Star of Literature (Chinese: 奎章閣學士院), first established in the spring of 1329 and designed to undertake "a number of tasks relating to the transmission of Confucian high culture to the Mongolian imperial establishment".
1554	7482	The academy was responsible for compiling and publishing a number of books, but its most important achievement was its compilation of a vast institutional compendium named Jingshi Dadian (Chinese: 經世大典).
1554	7483	Tugh Temür supported Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucianism and also devoted himself in Buddhism.
1555	7484	After the death of Tugh Temür in 1332 and subsequent death of Rinchinbal (Emperor Ningzong) the same year, the 13-year-old Toghun Temür (Emperor Huizong), the last of the nine successors of Kublai Khan, was summoned back from Guangxi and succeeded to the throne.
1555	7485	After El Temür's death, Bayan became as powerful an official as El Temür had been in the beginning of his long reign.
1555	7486	As Toghun Temür grew, he came to disapprove of Bayan's autocratic rule.
1555	7487	In 1340 he allied himself with Bayan's nephew Toqto'a, who was in discord with Bayan, and banished Bayan by coup.
1555	7488	With the dismissal of Bayan, Toghtogha seized the power of the court.
1555	7489	His first administration clearly exhibited fresh new spirit.
1555	7490	He also gave a few early signs of a new and positive direction in central government.
1555	7491	One of his successful projects was to finish the long-stalled official histories of the Liao, Jin, and Song dynasties, which were eventually completed in 1345.
1555	7492	Yet, Toghtogha resigned his office with the approval of Toghun Temür, marking the end of his first administration, and he was not called back until 1349.
1556	7493	The final years of the Yuan dynasty were marked by struggle, famine, and bitterness among the populace.
1556	7494	In time, Kublai Khan's successors lost all influence on other Mongol lands across Asia, while the Mongols beyond the Middle Kingdom saw them as too Chinese.
1556	7495	Gradually, they lost influence in China as well.
1556	7496	The reigns of the later Yuan emperors were short and marked by intrigues and rivalries.
1556	7497	Uninterested in administration, they were separated from both the army and the populace, and China was torn by dissension and unrest.
1556	7498	Outlaws ravaged the country without interference from the weakening Yuan armies.
1557	7499	From the late 1340s onwards, people in the countryside suffered from frequent natural disasters such as droughts, floods and the resulting famines, and the government's lack of effective policy led to a loss of popular support.
1557	7500	In 1351, the Red Turban Rebellion started and grew into a nationwide uprising.
1557	7501	In 1354, when Toghtogha led a large army to crush the Red Turban rebels, Toghun Temür suddenly dismissed him for fear of betrayal.
1557	7502	This resulted in Toghun Temür's restoration of power on the one hand and a rapid weakening of the central government on the other.
1557	7503	He had no choice but to rely on local warlords' military power, and gradually lost his interest in politics and ceased to intervene in political struggles.
1557	7504	He fled north to Shangdu from Khanbaliq (present-day Beijing) in 1368 after the approach of the forces of the Míng dynasty (1368–1644), founded by Zhu Yuanzhang in the south.
1557	7505	He had tried to regain Khanbaliq, which eventually failed; he died in Yingchang (located in present-day Inner Mongolia) two years later (1370).
1557	7506	Yingchang was seized by the Ming shortly after his death.
1557	7507	Some royal family members still lived in Henan today.
1558	7508	A rich cultural diversity developed during the Yuan dynasty.
1558	7509	The major cultural achievements were the development of drama and the novel and the increased use of the written vernacular.
1558	7510	The political unity of China and much of central Asia promoted trade between East and West.
1558	7511	The Mongols' extensive West Asian and European contacts produced a fair amount of cultural exchange.
1558	7512	The other cultures and peoples in the Mongol World Empire also very much influenced China.
1558	7513	It had significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia until its decline; the communications between Yuan dynasty and its ally and subordinate in Persia, the Ilkhanate, encouraged this development.
1558	7514	Buddhism had a great influence in the Yuan government, and the Tibetan-rite Tantric Buddhism had significantly influenced China during this period.
1558	7515	The Muslims of the Yuan dynasty introduced Middle Eastern cartography, astronomy, medicine, clothing, and diet in East Asia.
1558	7516	Eastern crops such as carrots, turnips, new varieties of lemons, eggplants, and melons, high-quality granulated sugar, and cotton were all either introduced or successfully popularized during the Yuan dynasty.
1559	7517	Western musical instruments were introduced to enrich Chinese performing arts.
1559	7518	From this period dates the conversion to Islam, by Muslims of Central Asia, of growing numbers of Chinese in the northwest and southwest.
1559	7519	Nestorianism and Roman Catholicism also enjoyed a period of toleration.
1559	7520	Buddhism (especially Tibetan Buddhism) flourished, although Taoism endured certain persecutions in favor of Buddhism from the Yuan government.
1559	7521	Confucian governmental practices and examinations based on the Classics, which had fallen into disuse in north China during the period of disunity, were reinstated by the Yuan court, probably in the hope of maintaining order over Han society.
1559	7522	Advances were realized in the fields of travel literature, cartography, geography, and scientific education.
1560	7523	The first recorded travels by Europeans to China and back date from this time.
1560	7524	The most famous traveler of the period was the Venetian Marco Polo, whose account of his trip to "Cambaluc," the capital of the Great Khan, and of life there astounded the people of Europe.
1560	7525	The account of his travels, Il milione (or, The Million, known in English as the Travels of Marco Polo), appeared about the year 1299.
1560	7526	Some argue over the accuracy of Marco Polo's accounts due to the lack of mentioning the Great Wall of China, tea houses, which would have been a prominent sight since Europeans had yet to adopt a tea culture, as well the practice of foot binding by the women in capital of the Great Khan.
1560	7527	Some suggest that Marco Polo acquired much of his knowledge through contact with Persian traders since many of the places he named were in Persian.
1561	7528	The Yuan undertook extensive public works.
1561	7529	Among Kublai Khan's top engineers and scientists was the astronomer Guo Shoujing, who was tasked with many public works projects and helped the Yuan reform the lunisolar calendar to provide an accuracy of 365.2425 days of the year, which was only 26 seconds off the modern Gregorian calendar's measurement.
1561	7530	Road and water communications were reorganized and improved.
1561	7531	To provide against possible famines, granaries were ordered built throughout the empire.
1561	7532	The city of Beijing was rebuilt with new palace grounds that included artificial lakes, hills and mountains, and parks.
1561	7533	During the Yuan period, Beijing became the terminus of the Grand Canal of China, which was completely renovated.
1561	7534	These commercially oriented improvements encouraged overland and maritime commerce throughout Asia and facilitated direct Chinese contacts with Europe.
1561	7535	Chinese travelers to the West were able to provide assistance in such areas as hydraulic engineering.
1561	7536	Contacts with the West also brought the introduction to China of a major food crop, sorghum, along with other foreign food products and methods of preparation.
1562	7537	The Yuan dynasty was the first time that non-native Chinese people ruled all of China.
1562	7538	In the historiography of Mongolia, it is generally considered to be the continuation of the Mongol Empire.
1562	7539	Mongols are widely known to worship the Eternal Heaven, and according to the traditional Mongolian ideology Yuan is considered to be "the beginning of an infinite number of beings, the foundation of peace and happiness, state power, the dream of many peoples, besides it there is nothing great or precious."
1562	7540	In traditional historiography of China, on the other hand, the Yuan dynasty is usually considered to be the legitimate dynasty between the Song dynasty and the Ming dynasty.
1562	7541	Note, however, Yuan dynasty is traditionally often extended to cover the Mongol Empire before Kublai Khan's formal establishment of the Yuan in 1271, partly because Kublai had his grandfather Genghis Khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or Taizu (Chinese: 太祖).
1562	7542	Despite the traditional historiography as well as the official views (including the government of the Ming dynasty which overthrew the Yuan dynasty), there also exist Chinese people[who?]
1562	7543	who did not consider the Yuan dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of China, but rather as a period of foreign domination.
1562	7544	The latter believe that Han Chinese were treated as second-class citizens,[citation needed] and that China stagnated economically and scientifically.
1563	7545	The system of bureaucracy created by Kublai Khan reflected various cultures in the empire, including that of the Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists.
1563	7546	While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures.
1563	7547	The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties.
1563	7548	Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign.
1563	7549	This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection.
1563	7550	The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance.
1563	7551	Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China.
1563	7552	At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards.
1564	7553	While the existence of these central government departments and the Six Ministries (which had been introduced since the Sui and Tang dynasties) gave a Sinicized image in the Yuan administration, the actual functions of these ministries also reflected how Mongolian priorities and policies reshaped and redirected those institutions.
1564	7554	For example, the authority of the Yuan legal system, the Ministry of Justice, did not extend to legal cases involving Mongols and Semuren, who had separate courts of justice.
1564	7555	Cases involving members of more than one ethnic group were decided by a mixed board consisting of Chinese and Mongols.
1564	7556	Another example was the insignificance of the Ministry of War compared with native Chinese dynasties, as the real military authority in Yuan times resided in the Privy Council.
1565	7557	Since its invention in 1269, the 'Phags-pa script, a unified script for spelling Mongolian, Tibetan, and Chinese languages, was preserved in the court until the end of the dynasty.
1565	7558	Most of the Emperors could not master written Chinese, but they could generally converse well in the language.
1565	7559	The Mongol custom of long standing quda/marriage alliance with Mongol clans, the Onggirat, and the Ikeres, kept the imperial blood purely Mongol until the reign of Tugh Temur, whose mother was a Tangut concubine.
1565	7560	The Mongol Emperors had built large palaces and pavilions, but some still continued to live as nomads at times.
1565	7561	Nevertheless, a few other Yuan emperors actively sponsored cultural activities; an example is Tugh Temur (Emperor Wenzong), who wrote poetry, painted, read Chinese classical texts, and ordered the compilation of books.
1566	7562	The average Mongol garrison family of the Yuan dynasty seems to have lived a life of decaying rural leisure, with income from the harvests of their Chinese tenants eaten up by costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty.
1566	7563	The Mongols practiced debt slavery, and by 1290 in all parts of the Mongol Empire commoners were selling their children into slavery.
1566	7564	Seeing this as damaging to the Mongol nation, Kublai in 1291 forbade the sale abroad of Mongols.
1566	7565	Kublai wished to persuade the Chinese that he was becoming increasingly sinicized while maintaining his Mongolian credentials with his own people.
1566	7566	He set up a civilian administration to rule, built a capital within China, supported Chinese religions and culture, and devised suitable economic and political institutions for the court.
1566	7567	But at the same time he never abandoned his Mongolian heritage.
1567	7568	In the China of the Yuan, or Mongol era, various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development, including the areas of painting, mathematics, calligraphy, poetry, and theater, with many great artists and writers being famous today.
1567	7569	Due to the coming together of painting, poetry, and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals, though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others.
1567	7570	Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy, the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together.
1567	7571	In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan dynasty there were many famous painters.
1567	7572	In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era.
1567	7573	In Yuan poetry, the main development was the qu, which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets.
1567	7574	Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time, and the other way around, with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu.
1567	7575	One of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form.
1567	7576	One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry, painting, and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art.
1567	7577	Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current, vernacular Chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show.
1567	7578	Another important consideration regarding Yuan dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in China, relatively to works from the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty, which have often been better preserved in places such as the Shōsōin, in Japan.
1568	7579	There were many religions practiced during the Yuan dynasty, such as Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity.
1568	7580	The establishment of the Yuan dynasty had dramatically increased the number of Muslims in China.
1568	7581	However, unlike the western khanates, the Yuan dynasty never converted to Islam.
1568	7582	Instead, Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty, favored Buddhism, especially the Tibetan variants.
1568	7583	As a result, Tibetan Buddhism was established as the de facto state religion.
1568	7584	The top-level department and government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) to supervise Buddhist monks throughout the empire.
1568	7585	Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important.
1568	7586	He and his successors kept a Sakya Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) at court.
1568	7587	Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leaders of the Sakya sect had held the post of Imperial Preceptor, thereby enjoying special power.
1568	7588	Furthermore, Mongol patronage of Buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of Buddhist art.
1568	7589	Mongolian Buddhist translations, almost all from Tibetan originals, began on a large scale after 1300.
1568	7590	Many Mongols of the upper class such as the Jalayir and the Oronar nobles as well as the emperors also patronized Confucian scholars and institutions.
1568	7591	A considerable number of Confucian and Chinese historical works were translated into the Mongolian language.
1569	7592	Advances in polynomial algebra were made by mathematicians during the Yuan era.
1569	7593	The mathematician Zhu Shijie (1249–1314) solved simultaneous equations with up to four unknowns using a rectangular array of coefficients, equivalent to modern matrices.
1569	7594	Zhu used a method of elimination to reduce the simultaneous equations to a single equation with only one unknown.
1569	7595	His method is described in the Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns, written in 1303.
1569	7596	The opening pages contain a diagram of Pascal's triangle.
1569	7597	The summation of a finite arithmetic series is also covered in the book.
1570	7598	Guo Shoujing applied mathematics to the construction of calendars.
1570	7599	He was one of the first mathematicians in China to work on spherical trigonometry.
1570	7600	Gou derived a cubic interpolation formula for his astronomical calculations.
1570	7601	His calendar, the Shoushi Li (授時暦) or Calendar for Fixing the Seasons, was disseminated in 1281 as the official calendar of the Yuan dynasty.
1570	7602	The calendar may have been influenced solely by the work of Song dynasty astronomer Shen Kuo or possibly by the work of Arab astronomers.
1570	7603	There are no explicit signs of Muslim influences in the Shoushi calendar, but Mongol rulers were known to be interested in Muslim calendars.
1570	7604	Mathematical knowledge from the Middle East was introduced to China under the Mongols, and Muslim astronomers brought Arabic numerals to China in the 13th century.
1571	7605	The physicians of the Yuan court came from diverse cultures.
1571	7606	Healers were divided into non-Mongol physicians called otachi and traditional Mongol shamans.
1571	7607	The Mongols characterized otachi doctors by their use of herbal remedies, which was distinguished from the spiritual cures of Mongol shamanism.
1571	7608	Physicians received official support from the Yuan government and were given special legal privileges.
1571	7609	Kublai created the Imperial Academy of Medicine to manage medical treatises and the education of new doctors.
1571	7610	Confucian scholars were attracted to the medical profession because it ensured a high income and medical ethics were compatible with Confucian virtues.
1572	7611	The Chinese medical tradition of the Yuan had "Four Great Schools" that the Yuan inherited from the Jin dynasty.
1572	7612	All four schools were based on the same intellectual foundation, but advocated different theoretical approaches toward medicine.
1572	7613	Under the Mongols, the practice of Chinese medicine spread to other parts of the empire.
1572	7614	Chinese physicians were brought along military campaigns by the Mongols as they expanded towards the west.
1572	7615	Chinese medical techniques such as acupuncture, moxibustion, pulse diagnosis, and various herbal drugs and elixirs were transmitted westward to the Middle East and the rest of the empire.
1572	7616	Several medical advances were made in the Yuan period.
1572	7617	The physician Wei Yilin (1277–1347) invented a suspension method for reducing dislocated joints, which he performed using anesthetics.
1572	7618	The Mongol physician Hu Sihui described the importance of a healthy diet in a 1330 medical treatise.
1573	7619	Western medicine was also practiced in China by the Nestorian Christians of the Yuan court, where it was sometimes labeled as huihui or Muslim medicine.
1573	7620	The Nestorian physician Jesus the Interpreter founded the Office of Western Medicine in 1263 during the reign of Kublai.
1573	7621	Huihui doctors staffed at two imperial hospitals were responsible for treating the imperial family and members of the court.
1573	7622	Chinese physicians opposed Western medicine because its humoral system contradicted the yin-yang and wuxing philosophy underlying traditional Chinese medicine.
1573	7623	No Chinese translation of Western medical works is known, but it is possible that the Chinese had access to Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine.
1574	7624	The Mongol rulers patronized the Yuan printing industry.
1574	7625	Chinese printing technology was transferred to the Mongols through Kingdom of Qocho and Tibetan intermediaries.
1574	7626	Some Yuan documents such as Wang Zhen's Nong Shu were printed with earthenware movable type, a technology invented in the 12th century.
1574	7627	However, most published works were still produced through traditional block printing techniques.
1574	7628	The publication of a Taoist text inscribed with the name of Töregene Khatun, Ögedei's wife, is one of the first printed works sponsored by the Mongols.
1574	7629	In 1273, the Mongols created the Imperial Library Directorate, a government-sponsored printing office.
1574	7630	The Yuan government established centers for printing throughout China.
1574	7631	Local schools and government agencies were funded to support the publishing of books.
1575	7632	One of the more notable applications of printing technology was the chao, the paper money of the Yuan.
1575	7633	Chao were made from the bark of mulberry trees.
1575	7634	The Yuan government used woodblocks to print paper money, but switched to bronze plates in 1275.
1575	7635	The Mongols experimented with establishing the Chinese-style paper monetary system in Mongol-controlled territories outside of China.
1575	7636	The Yuan minister Bolad was sent to Iran, where he explained Yuan paper money to the Il-khanate court of Gaykhatu.
1575	7637	The Il-khanate government issued paper money in 1294, but public distrust of the exotic new currency doomed the experiment.
1576	7638	Politically, the system of government created by Kublai Khan was the product of a compromise between Mongolian patrimonial feudalism and the traditional Chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system.
1576	7639	Nevertheless, socially the educated Chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native Chinese dynasties.
1576	7640	Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power, the Mongols and the Semuren (various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire) largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong "colonial" coloration.
1576	7641	The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule.
1576	7642	The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty, and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century.
1576	7643	In general there were very few North Chinese or Southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate.
1576	7644	Later the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the Yuan dynasty.
1576	7645	In response to an objection against the use of "barbarians" in his government, the Yongle Emperor answered: "...
1576	7646	Discrimination was used by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty, who employed only "Mongols and Tartars" and discarded northern and southern Chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them".
1577	7647	At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands.
1577	7648	Han Chinese were moved to Central Asian areas like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand by the Mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers.
1577	7649	Alans were recruited into the Mongol forces with one unit called "Right Alan Guard" which was combined with "recently surrendered" soldiers, Mongols, and Chinese soldiers stationed in the area of the former Kingdom of Qocho and in Besh Balikh the Mongols established a Chinese military colony led by Chinese general Qi Kongzhi (Ch'i Kung-chih).
1577	7650	After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia by Genghis Khan, foreigners were chosen as administrators and co-management with Chinese and Qara-Khitays (Khitans) of gardens and fields in Samarqand was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them.
1577	7651	The Mongol appointed Governor of Samarqand was a Qara-Khitay (Khitan), held the title Taishi, familiar with Chinese culture his name was Ahai
1578	7652	Despite the high position given to Muslims, some policies of the Yuan Emperors severely discriminated against them, restricting Halal slaughter and other Islamic practices like circumcision, as well as Kosher butchering for Jews, forcing them to eat food the Mongol way.
1578	7653	Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols.
1578	7654	The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat.
1578	7655	Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant "barracks" and could also mean "thanks".
1578	7656	Many Hui Muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them.
1578	7657	During the war fighting the Mongols, among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng.
1578	7658	The Muslims in the semu class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah Rebellion but the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding.
1579	7659	The historian Frederick W. Mote wrote that the usage of the term "social classes" for this system was misleading and that the position of people within the four-class system was not an indication of their actual social power and wealth, but just entailed "degrees of privilege" to which they were entitled institutionally and legally, so a person's standing within the classes was not a guarantee of their standing, since there were rich and well socially standing Chinese while there were less rich Mongol and Semu than there were Mongol and Semu who lived in poverty and were ill treated.
1580	7660	The reason for the order of the classes and the reason why people were placed in a certain class was the date they surrendered to the Mongols, and had nothing to do with their ethnicity.
1580	7661	The earlier they surrendered to the Mongols, the higher they were placed, the more the held out, the lower they were ranked.
1580	7662	The Northern Chinese were ranked higher and Southern Chinese were ranked lower because southern China withstood and fought to the last before caving in.
1580	7663	Major commerce during this era gave rise to favorable conditions for private southern Chinese manufacturers and merchants.
1581	7664	When the Mongols placed the Uighurs of the Kingdom of Qocho over the Koreans at the court the Korean King objected, then the Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan rebuked the Korean King, saying that the Uighur King of Qocho was ranked higher than the Karluk Kara-Khanid ruler, who in turn was ranked higher than the Korean King, who was ranked last, because the Uighurs surrendered to the Mongols first, the Karluks surrendered after the Uighurs, and the Koreans surrendered last, and that the Uighurs surrendered peacefully without violently resisting.
1582	7665	The Central Region, consisting of present-day Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, the south-eastern part of present-day Inner Mongolia and the Henan areas to the north of the Yellow River, was considered the most important region of the dynasty and directly governed by the Central Secretariat (or Zhongshu Sheng) at Khanbaliq (modern Beijing); similarly, another top-level administrative department called the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (or Xuanzheng Yuan) held administrative rule over the whole of modern-day Tibet and a part of Sichuan, Qinghai and Kashmir.
1583	7666	Kenya (/ˈkɛnjə/; locally [ˈkɛɲa] ( listen)), officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African Community (EAC).
1583	7667	Its capital and largest city is Nairobi.
1583	7668	Kenya's territory lies on the equator and overlies the East African Rift covering a diverse and expansive terrain that extends roughly from Lake Victoria to Lake Turkana (formerly called Lake Rudolf) and further south-east to the Indian Ocean.
1583	7669	It is bordered by Tanzania to the south, Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north-west, Ethiopia to the north and Somalia to the north-east.
1583	7670	Kenya covers 581,309 km2 (224,445 sq mi), and had a population of approximately 45 million people in July 2014.
1584	7671	Kenya has a warm and humid tropical climate on its Indian Ocean coastline.
1584	7672	The climate is cooler in the savannah grasslands around the capital city, Nairobi, and especially closer to Mount Kenya, which has snow permanently on its peaks.
1584	7673	Further inland, in the Nyanza region, there is a hot and dry climate which becomes humid around Lake Victoria, the largest tropical fresh-water lake in the world.
1584	7674	This gives way to temperate and forested hilly areas in the neighboring western region.
1584	7675	The north-eastern regions along the border with Somalia and Ethiopia are arid and semi-arid areas with near-desert landscapes.
1584	7676	Kenya is known for its safaris, diverse climate and geography, and expansive wildlife reserves and national parks such as the East and West Tsavo National Park, the Maasai Mara, Lake Nakuru National Park, and Aberdares National Park.
1584	7677	Kenya has several world heritage sites such as Lamu and numerous beaches, including in Diani, Bamburi and Kilifi, where international yachting competitions are held every year.
1585	7678	The African Great Lakes region, which Kenya is a part of, has been inhabited by humans since the Lower Paleolithic period.
1585	7679	By the first millennium AD, the Bantu expansion had reached the area from West-Central Africa.
1585	7680	The borders of the modern state consequently comprise the crossroads of the Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic areas of the continent, representing most major ethnolinguistic groups found in Africa.
1585	7681	Bantu and Nilotic populations together constitute around 97% of the nation's residents.
1585	7682	European and Arab presence in coastal Mombasa dates to the Early Modern period; European exploration of the interior began in the 19th century.
1585	7683	The British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895, which starting in 1920 gave way to the Kenya Colony.
1585	7684	Kenya obtained independence in December 1963.
1585	7685	Following a referendum in August 2010 and adoption of a new constitution, Kenya is now divided into 47 semi-autonomous counties, governed by elected governors.
1586	7686	The Republic of Kenya is named after Mount Kenya.
1586	7687	The origin of the name Kenya is not clear, but perhaps linked to the Kikuyu, Embu and Kamba words Kirinyaga, Kirenyaa and Kiinyaa which mean "God's resting place" in all three languages.
1586	7688	If so, then the British may not so much have mispronounced it ('Keenya'), as misspelled it.
1586	7689	Prehistoric volcanic eruptions of Mount Kenya (now extinct) may have resulted in its association with divinity and creation among the indigenous Bantu ethnic groups, who are the native inhabitants of the agricultural land surrounding Mount Kenya.
1587	7690	Ludwig Krapf recorded the name as both Kenia and Kegnia believed by most to be a corruption of the Kamba version.
1587	7691	Others say that this was—on the contrary—a very precise notation of a correct African pronunciation /ˈkɛnjə/.
1587	7692	An 1882 map drawn by Joseph Thompsons, a Scottish geologist and naturalist, indicated Mt.
1587	7693	Controversy over the actual meaning of the word Kenya notwithstanding, it is clear that the mountain's name became widely accepted, pars pro toto, as the name of the country.
1588	7694	The "Big Five" game animals of Africa, that is the lion, leopard, buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephant, can be found in Kenya and in the Masai Mara in particular.
1588	7695	A significant population of other wild animals, reptiles and birds can be found in the national parks and game reserves in the country.
1588	7696	The annual animal migration occurs between June and September with millions of animals taking part, attracting valuable foreign tourism.
1588	7697	Two million wildebeest migrate a distance of 2,900 kilometres (1,802 mi) from the Serengeti in neighbouring Tanzania to the Masai Mara in Kenya, in a constant clockwise fashion, searching for food and water supplies.
1588	7698	This Serengeti Migration of the wildebeest is a curious spectacle listed among the 10 Natural Wonders of Africa.
1589	7699	Fossils found in Kenya suggest that primates roamed the area more than 20 million years ago.
1589	7700	Recent findings near Lake Turkana indicate that hominids such as Homo habilis (1.8 and 2.5 million years ago) and Homo erectus (1.8 million to 350,000 years ago) are possible direct ancestors of modern Homo sapiens, and lived in Kenya in the Pleistocene epoch.
1589	7701	During excavations at Lake Turkana in 1984, paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey assisted by Kamoya Kimeu discovered the Turkana Boy, a 1.6-million-year-old fossil belonging to Homo erectus.
1589	7702	Previous research on early hominids is particularly identified with Mary Leakey and Louis Leakey, who were responsible for the preliminary archaeological research at Olorgesailie and Hyrax Hill.
1589	7703	Later work at the former site was undertaken by Glynn Isaac.
1590	7704	The Swahili built Mombasa into a major port city and established trade links with other nearby city-states, as well as commercial centres in Persia, Arabia, and even India.
1590	7705	By the 15th-century, Portuguese voyager Duarte Barbosa claimed that "Mombasa is a place of great traffic and has a good harbour in which there are always moored small craft of many kinds and also great ships, both of which are bound from Sofala and others which come from Cambay and Melinde and others which sail to the island of Zanzibar."
1591	7706	Throughout the centuries, the Kenyan Coast has played host to many merchants and explorers.
1591	7707	Among the cities that line the Kenyan coast is the City of Malindi.
1591	7708	It has remained an important Swahili settlement since the 14th century and once rivalled Mombasa for dominance in the African Great Lakes region.
1591	7709	Malindi has traditionally been a friendly port city for foreign powers.
1591	7710	In 1414, the Chinese trader and explorer Zheng He representing the Ming Dynasty visited the East African coast on one of his last 'treasure voyages'.
1591	7711	Malindi authorities welcomed the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in 1498.
1592	7712	At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the governors of British East Africa (as the Protectorate was generally known) and German East Africa agreed a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities.
1592	7713	Lt Col Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck took command of the German military forces, determined to tie down as many British resources as possible.
1592	7714	Completely cut off from Germany, von Lettow conducted an effective guerrilla warfare campaign, living off the land, capturing British supplies, and remaining undefeated.
1592	7715	He eventually surrendered in Northern Rhodesia (today Zambia) fourteen days after the Armistice was signed in 1918.
1593	7716	The central highlands were already home to over a million members of the Kikuyu people, most of whom had no land claims in European terms and lived as itinerant farmers.
1593	7717	To protect their interests, the settlers banned the growing of coffee, introduced a hut tax, and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour.
1593	7718	A massive exodus to the cities ensued as their ability to provide a living from the land dwindled.
1593	7719	There were 80,000 white settlers living in Kenya in the 1950s.
1594	7720	The capture of Warũhiũ Itote (aka General China) on 15 January 1954 and the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure.
1594	7721	Operation Anvil opened on 24 April 1954, after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the War Council.
1594	7722	The operation effectively placed Nairobi under military siege, and the occupants were screened and the Mau Mau supporters moved to detention camps.
1594	7723	The Home Guard formed the core of the government's strategy as it was composed of loyalist Africans, not foreign forces like the British Army and King's African Rifles.
1594	7724	By the end of the emergency, the Home Guard had killed 4,686 Mau Mau, amounting to 42% of the total insurgents.
1594	7725	The capture of Dedan Kimathi on 21 October 1956 in Nyeri signified the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau and essentially ended the military offensive.
1594	7726	During this period, substantial governmental changes to land tenure occurred.
1594	7727	The most important of these was the Swynnerton Plan, which was used to both reward loyalists and punish Mau Mau.
1595	7728	The first direct elections for native Kenyans to the Legislative Council took place in 1957.
1595	7729	Despite British hopes of handing power to "moderate" local rivals, it was the Kenya African National Union (KANU) of Jomo Kenyatta that formed a government.
1595	7730	The Colony of Kenya and the Protectorate of Kenya each came to an end on 12 December 1963 with independence being conferred on all of Kenya.
1595	7731	The United Kingdom ceded sovereignty over the Colony of Kenya and, under an agreement dated 8 October 1963, the Sultan of Zanzibar agreed that simultaneous with independence for the Colony of Kenya, the Sultan would cease to have sovereignty over the Protectorate of Kenya so that all of Kenya would be one sovereign, independent state.
1595	7732	In this way, Kenya became an independent country under the Kenya Independence Act 1963 of the United Kingdom.
1595	7733	Exactly 12 months later on 12 December 1964, Kenya became a republic under the name "Republic of Kenya".
1596	7734	The election held in 1988 saw the advent of the mlolongo (queuing) system, where voters were supposed to line up behind their favoured candidates instead of a secret ballot.
1596	7735	This was seen as the climax of a very undemocratic regime and it led to widespread agitation for constitutional reform.
1596	7736	Several contentious clauses, including one that allowed for only one political party were changed in the following years.
1596	7737	In democratic, multiparty elections in 1992 and 1997, Daniel arap Moi won re-election.
1597	7738	Kenya is a presidential representative democratic republic.
1597	7739	The President is both the head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system.
1597	7740	Executive power is exercised by the government.
1597	7741	Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly and the Senate.
1597	7742	The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.
1597	7743	There was growing concern especially during former president Daniel arap Moi's tenure that the executive was increasingly meddling with the affairs of the judiciary.
1598	7744	Kenya ranks low on Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (CPI), a metric which attempts to gauge the prevalence of public sector corruption in various countries.
1598	7745	In 2012, the nation placed 139th out of 176 total countries in the CPI, with a score of 27/100.
1598	7746	However, there are several rather significant developments with regards to curbing corruption from the Kenyan government, for instance, the establishment of a new and independent Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).
1599	7747	In the Presidential elections, President Kibaki under the Party of National Unity ran for re-election against the main opposition party, the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM).
1599	7748	The elections were seen to have been flawed with international observers saying that they were below international standards.
1599	7749	After a split which took a crucial 8% of the votes away from the ODM to the newly formed Orange Democratic Movement-Kenya (ODM-K)'s candidate, Kalonzo Musyoka, the race tightened between ODM candidate Raila Odinga and Kibaki.
1599	7750	As the count came into the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK) headquarters, Odinga was shown to have a slight, and then substantial lead as the results from his strongholds came in early.
1599	7751	As the ECK continued to count the votes, Kibaki closed the gap and then overtook his opponent by a substantial margin after votes from his stronghold arrived later.
1599	7752	This led to protests and open discrediting of the ECK for complicity and to Odinga declaring himself the "people's president" and calling for a recount.
1600	7753	Since the election riots, the government and civil society organisations started programmes to avoid similar disasters in the future, said Agnes R. M. Aboum – executive director of TAABCO Research and Development Consultants in Nairobi – in the magazine D+C Development and Cooperation.
1600	7754	For example, the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission initiated community dialogues, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Kenya started peace meetings and the Kenya National Dialogue and Reconciliation process was started.
1601	7755	On 28 February 2008, Kibaki and Odinga signed an agreement on the formation of a coalition government in which Odinga would become Kenya's second Prime Minister.
1601	7756	Under the deal, the president would appoint cabinet ministers from both PNU and ODM camps depending on each party's strength in Parliament.
1601	7757	The agreement stipulated that the cabinet would include a vice-president and two deputy Prime Ministers.
1601	7758	After debates, it was passed by Parliament, the coalition would hold until the end of the current Parliament or if either of the parties withdraws from the deal before then.
1602	7759	The new office of the PM will have power and authority to co-ordinate and supervise the functions of the Government and will be occupied by an elected MP who will be the leader of the party or coalition with majority members in Parliament.
1602	7760	The world watched Annan and his UN-backed panel and African Union chairman Jakaya Kikwete as they brought together the former rivals to the signing ceremony, beamed live on national TV from the steps of Nairobi's Harambee House.
1602	7761	On 29 February 2008, representatives of PNU and ODM began working on the finer details of the power-sharing agreement.
1602	7762	Kenyan lawmakers unanimously approved a power-sharing deal 18 March 2008, aimed at salvaging a country usually seen as one of the most stable and prosperous in Africa.
1602	7763	The deal brought Kibaki's PNU and Odinga's ODM together and heralded the formation of the grand coalition, in which the two political parties would share power equally.
1603	7764	A constitutional change was considered that would eliminate the position of Prime Minister and simultaneously reduce the powers of the President.
1603	7765	A referendum to vote on the proposed constitution was held on 4 August 2010, and the new constitution passed by a wide margin.
1603	7766	Among other things, the new constitution delegates more power to local governments and gives Kenyans a bill of rights.
1603	7767	It was promulgated on 27 August 2010 at a euphoric ceremony in Nairobi's Uhuru Park, accompanied by a 21-gun salute.
1603	7768	The event was attended by various African leaders and praised by the international community.
1603	7769	As of that day, the new constitution heralding the Second Republic came into force.
1604	7770	In December 2014, President Uhuru Kenyatta signed a Security Laws Amendment Bill, which supporters of the law suggested was necessary to guard against armed groups.
1604	7771	Opposition politicians, human rights groups, and nine Western countries criticised the security bill, arguing that it infringed on democratic freedoms.
1604	7772	The governments of the United States, Britain, Germany and France also collectively issued a press statement cautioning about the law's potential impact.
1604	7773	Through the Jubillee Coalition, the Bill was later passed on 19 December in the National Assembly under acrimonious circumstances.
1605	7774	With International Criminal Court trial dates in 2013 for both President Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto related to the 2007 election aftermath, US President Barack Obama chose not to visit the country during his mid-2013 African trip.
1605	7775	Later in the summer, Kenyatta visited China at the invitation of President Xi Jinping after a stop in Russia and not having visited the United States as president.
1605	7776	In July 2015 Obama visited Kenya, as the first American president to visit the country while in office.
1606	7777	The armed forces are regularly deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world.
1606	7778	Further, in the aftermath of the national elections of December 2007 and the violence that subsequently engulfed the country, a commission of inquiry, the Waki Commission, commended its readiness and adjudged it to "have performed its duty well."
1606	7779	Nevertheless, there have been serious allegations of human rights violations, most recently while conducting counter-insurgency operations in the Mt Elgon area and also in the district of Mandera central.
1607	7780	Kenya’s armed forces, like many government institutions in the country, have been tainted by corruption allegations.
1607	7781	Because the operations of the armed forces have been traditionally cloaked by the ubiquitous blanket of “state security”, the corruption has been less in public view, and thus less subject to public scrutiny and notoriety.
1607	7782	In what are by Kenyan standards unprecedented revelations, in 2010, credible claims of corruption were made with regard to recruitment  and procurement of Armoured Personnel Carriers.
1607	7783	Further, the wisdom and prudence of certain decisions of procurement have been publicly questioned.
1608	7784	Although Kenya is the biggest and most advanced economy in east and central Africa, and has an affluent urban minority, it has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.519, ranked 145 out of 186 in the world.
1608	7785	As of 2005, 17.7% of Kenyans lived on less than $1.25 a day.
1608	7786	The important agricultural sector is one of the least developed and largely inefficient, employing 75% of the workforce compared to less than 3% in the food secure developed countries.
1608	7787	Kenya is usually classified as a frontier market or occasionally an emerging market, but it is not one of the least developed countries.
1609	7788	East and Central Africa's biggest economy has posted tremendous growth in the service sector, boosted by rapid expansion in telecommunication and financial activity over the last decade, and now[when?]
1609	7789	22% of GDP still comes from the unreliable agricultural sector which employs 75% of the labour force (a consistent characteristic of under-developed economies that have not attained food security – an important catalyst of economic growth) A small portion of the population relies on food aid.
1609	7790	[citation needed] Industry and manufacturing is the smallest sector, accounting for 16% of GDP.
1609	7791	The service, industry and manufacturing sectors only employ 25% of the labour force but contribute 75% of GDP.
1610	7792	Kenya's services sector, which contributes 61% of GDP, is dominated by tourism.
1610	7793	The tourism sector has exhibited steady growth in most years since independence and by the late 1980s had become the country's principal source of foreign exchange.
1610	7794	Tourists, the largest number being from Germany and the United Kingdom, are attracted mainly to the coastal beaches and the game reserves, notably, the expansive East and West Tsavo National Park 20,808 square kilometres (8,034 sq mi) in the southeast.
1610	7795	Tourism has seen a substantial revival over the past several years and is the major contributor to the pick-up in the country's economic growth.
1610	7796	Tourism is now Kenya's largest foreign exchange earning sector, followed by flowers, tea, and coffee.
1610	7797	In 2006 tourism generated US$803 million, up from US$699 million the previous year.
1610	7798	Presently, there are also numerous Shopping Malls in Kenya.
1610	7799	In addition, there are four main hypermarket chains in Kenya.
1611	7800	Agriculture is the second largest contributor to Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP), after the service sector.
1611	7801	In 2005 agriculture, including forestry and fishing, accounted for 24% of GDP, as well as for 18% of wage employment and 50% of revenue from exports.
1611	7802	The principal cash crops are tea, horticultural produce, and coffee.
1611	7803	Horticultural produce and tea are the main growth sectors and the two most valuable of all of Kenya's exports.
1611	7804	The production of major food staples such as corn is subject to sharp weather-related fluctuations.
1611	7805	Production downturns periodically necessitate food aid—for example, in 2004 aid for 1.8 million people because of one of Kenya's intermittent droughts.
1612	7806	A consortium led by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has had some success in helping farmers grow new pigeon pea varieties, instead of maize, in particularly dry areas.
1612	7807	Pigeon peas are very drought resistant, so can be grown in areas with less than 650 mm annual rainfall.
1612	7808	Successive projects encouraged the commercialisation of legumes, by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing.
1612	7809	This work, which included linking producers to wholesalers, helped to increase local producer prices by 20–25% in Nairobi and Mombasa.
1612	7810	The commercialisation of the pigeon pea is now enabling some farmers to buy assets, ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock, and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty.
1613	7811	Tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands, one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa.
1613	7812	Livestock predominates in the semi-arid savanna to the north and east.
1613	7813	Coconuts, pineapples, cashew nuts, cotton, sugarcane, sisal, and corn are grown in the lower-lying areas.
1613	7814	Unfortunately, the country has not attained the level of investment and efficiency in agriculture that can guarantee food security and coupled with resulting poverty (53% of the population lives below the poverty line), a significant portion of the population regularly starves and is heavily dependent on food aid.
1613	7815	Poor roads, an inadequate railway network, under-used water transport and expensive air transport have isolated mostly arid and semi-arid areas and farmers in other regions often leave food to rot in the fields because they cannot access markets.
1613	7816	This was last seen in August and September 2011 prompting the Kenyans for Kenya initiative by the Red Cross.
1614	7817	Although Kenya is the most industrially developed country in the African Great Lakes region, manufacturing still accounts for only 14% of the GDP.
1614	7818	Industrial activity, concentrated around the three largest urban centres, Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, is dominated by food-processing industries such as grain milling, beer production, and sugarcane crushing, and the fabrication of consumer goods, e.g., vehicles from kits.
1614	7819	There is a cement production industry.
1614	7820	[citation needed] Kenya has an oil refinery that processes imported crude petroleum into petroleum products, mainly for the domestic market.
1614	7821	In addition, a substantial and expanding informal sector commonly referred to as Jua Kali engages in small-scale manufacturing of household goods, motor-vehicle parts, and farm implements.
1615	7822	Kenya's inclusion among the beneficiaries of the US Government's African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) has given a boost to manufacturing in recent years.
1615	7823	Since AGOA took effect in 2000, Kenya's clothing sales to the United States increased from US$44 million to US$270 million (2006).
1615	7824	[citation needed] Other initiatives to strengthen manufacturing have been the new government's favourable tax measures, including the removal of duty on capital equipment and other raw materials.
1616	7825	The largest share of Kenya's electricity supply comes from hydroelectric stations at dams along the upper Tana River, as well as the Turkwel Gorge Dam in the west.
1616	7826	A petroleum-fired plant on the coast, geothermal facilities at Olkaria (near Nairobi), and electricity imported from Uganda make up the rest of the supply.
1616	7827	Kenya's installed capacity stood at 1,142 megawatts between 2001 and 2003.
1616	7828	The state-owned Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), established in 1997 under the name of Kenya Power Company, handles the generation of electricity, while Kenya Power handles the electricity transmission and distribution system in the country.
1616	7829	Shortfalls of electricity occur periodically, when drought reduces water flow.
1616	7830	To become energy sufficient, Kenya aims to build a nuclear power plant by 2017.
1617	7831	Kenya has proven deposits of oil in Turkana and the commercial viability was just discovered.
1617	7832	Tullow Oil estimates Kenya's oil reserves to be around 10 billion barrels.
1617	7833	Exploration is still continuing to determine if there are more reserves.
1617	7834	Kenya currently imports all crude petroleum requirements.
1617	7835	Kenya, east Africa's largest economy, has no strategic reserves and relies solely on oil marketers' 21-day oil reserves required under industry regulations.
1617	7836	Petroleum accounts for 20% to 25% of the national import bill.
1618	7837	Published comments on Kenya's Capital FM website by Liu Guangyuan, China's ambassador to Kenya, at the time of President Kenyatta's 2013 trip to Beijing, said, "Chinese investment in Kenya ... reached $474 million, representing Kenya's largest source of foreign direct investment, and ... bilateral trade ... reached $2.84 billion" in 2012.
1618	7838	Kenyatta was "[a]ccompanied by 60 Kenyan business people [and hoped to] ... gain support from China for a planned $2.5 billion railway from the southern Kenyan port of Mombasa to neighboring Uganda, as well as a nearly $1.8 billion dam", according to a statement from the president's office also at the time of the trip.
1618	7839	Base Titanium, a subsidiary of Base resources of Australia, shipped its first major consignment of minerals to China.
1618	7840	About 25,000 tonnes of ilmenite was flagged off the Kenyan coastal town of Kilifi.
1618	7841	The first shipment was expected to earn Kenya about Shs15 – Shs20 Billion in earnings.
1618	7842	China has been causing environmental and social problems that include the recent suspension of the railway project.
1619	7843	In 2007, the Kenyan government unveiled Vision 2030, an economic development programme it hopes will put the country in the same league as the Asian Economic Tigers by the year 2030.
1619	7844	In 2013, it launched a National Climate Change Action Plan, having acknowledged that omitting climate as a key development issue in Vision 2030 was an oversight.
1619	7845	The 200-page Action Plan, developed with support from the Climate & Development Knowledge Network, sets out the Government of Kenya's vision for a 'low carbon climate resilient development pathway'.
1619	7846	At the launch in March 2013, the Secretary of the Ministry of Planning, National Development and Vision 2030 emphasised that climate will be a central issue in the renewed Medium Term Plan that will be launched in the coming months.
1619	7847	This will create a direct and robust delivery framework for the Action Plan and ensure climate change is treated as an economy-wide issue.
1620	7848	Child labour is common in Kenya.
1620	7849	Most working children are active in agriculture.
1620	7850	In 2006, UNICEF estimated that up to 30% of girls in the coastal areas of Malindi, Mombasa, Kilifi, and Diani were subject to prostitution.
1620	7851	Most of the prostitutes in Kenya are aged 9–18.
1620	7852	The Ministry of Gender and Child Affairs employed 400 child protection officers in 2009.
1620	7853	The causes of child labour include poverty, the lack of access to education and weak government institutions.
1620	7854	81 on labour inspection in industries and Convention No.
1620	7855	129 on labour inspection in agriculture.
1621	7856	Kenya's various ethnic groups typically speak their mother tongues within their own communities.
1621	7857	The two official languages, English and Swahili, are used in varying degrees of fluency for communication with other populations.
1621	7858	English is widely spoken in commerce, schooling and government.
1621	7859	Peri-urban and rural dwellers are less multilingual, with many in rural areas speaking only their native languages.
1621	7860	British English is primarily used in the country.
1621	7861	Additionally, a distinct local dialect, Kenyan English, is used by some communities and individuals in the country, and contains features unique to it that were derived from local Bantu languages, such as Swahili and Kikuyu.
1621	7862	It has been developing since colonisation and also contains certain elements of American English.
1621	7863	Sheng is a Swahili-based cant spoken in some urban areas.
1621	7864	Primarily consisting of a mixture of Swahili and English, it is an example of linguistic code-switching.
1622	7865	The vast majority of Kenyans are Christian (83%), with 47.7% regarding themselves as Protestant and 23.5% as Roman Catholic of the Latin Rite.
1622	7866	The Presbyterian Church of East Africa has 3 million followers in Kenya and the surrounding countries.
1622	7867	There are smaller conservative Reformed churches, the Africa Evangelical Presbyterian Church, the Independent Presbyterian Church in Kenya, and the Reformed Church of East Africa.
1622	7868	621,200 of Kenyans are Orthodox Christians.
1622	7869	Notably, Kenya has the highest number of Quakers in the world, with around 133,000 members.
1622	7870	The only Jewish synagogue in the country is located in the capital, Nairobi.
1623	7871	Sizeable minorities of other faiths do exist (Muslim 11.2%, indigenous beliefs 1.7%), and nonreligious 2.4%.
1623	7872	Sixty percent of the Muslim population lives in Kenya's Coastal Region, comprising 50% of the total population there.
1623	7873	Roughly 4% of Muslims are Ahmadiyya, 8% Shia and another 8% are non-denominational Muslims, while 73% are Sunni.
1623	7874	Western areas of the Coast Region are mostly Christian.
1623	7875	The upper part of Kenya's Eastern Region is home to 10% of the country's Muslims, where they constitute the majority religious group.
1623	7876	In addition, there is a large Hindu population in Kenya (around 300,000), who have played a key role in the local economy; they are mostly of Indian origin.
1624	7877	Nurses treat 80% of the population who visit dispensaries, health centres and private clinics in rural and under-served urban areas.
1624	7878	Complicated cases are referred to clinical officers, medical officers and medical practitioners.
1624	7879	According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, in 2011 there were 65,000 qualified nurses registered in the country; 8,600 clinical officers and 7,000 doctors for the population of 43 million people (These figures from official registers include those who have died or left the profession hence the actual number of these workers may be lower).
1625	7880	Diseases of poverty directly correlate with a country's economic performance and wealth distribution: Half of Kenyans live below the poverty level.
1625	7881	Preventable diseases like malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition are the biggest burden, major child-killers, and responsible for much morbidity; weak policies, corruption, inadequate health workers, weak management and poor leadership in the public health sector are largely to blame.
1625	7882	According to 2009 estimates, HIV prevalence is about 6.3% of the adult population.
1625	7883	However, the 2011 UNAIDS Report suggests that the HIV epidemic may be improving in Kenya, as HIV prevalence is declining among young people (ages 15–24) and pregnant women.
1625	7884	Kenya had an estimated 15 million cases of malaria in 2006.
1626	7885	Kenya's first system of education was introduced by British colonists.
1626	7886	After Kenya's independence on 12 December 1963, an authority named the Ominde Commission was formed to introduce changes that would reflect the nation's sovereignty.
1626	7887	The commission focused on identity and unity, which were critical issues at the time.
1626	7888	Changes in the subject content of history and geography were made to reflect national cohesion.
1626	7889	Between 1964 and 1985, the 7–4–2–3 system was adopted – seven years of primary, four years of lower secondary, two years of upper secondary, and three years of university.
1626	7890	All schools had a common curriculum.
1627	7891	In 1981, the Presidential Working Party on the Second University was commissioned to look at both the possibilities of setting up a second university in Kenya as well as the reforming of the entire education system.
1627	7892	The committee recommended that the 7–4–2–3 system be changed to an 8–4–4 system (eight years in primary, four years in secondary, and four years in university education).
1627	7893	The table under Present-day education in Kenya below shows the structure of the 8–4–4 system.
1627	7894	Although the 7–4–2–3 system theoretically ended with the introduction of the new 8–4–4 system in 1985, the last batch of students from the former system graduated from Kenyan Universities in 1992.
1628	7895	The current 8–4–4 system was launched in January 1985.
1628	7896	It put more emphasis on vocational subjects on the assumption that the new structure would enable school drop-outs at all levels either to be self-employed or to secure employment in the informal sector.
1628	7897	In January 2003, the Government of Kenya announced the introduction of free primary education.
1628	7898	As a result, primary school enrolment increased by about 70%.
1628	7899	Secondary and tertiary education enrolment has not increased proportionally because payment is still required for attendance.
1628	7900	In 2007 the government issued a statement declaring that from 2008, secondary education would be heavily subsidiszed, with the government footing all tuition fees.
1629	7901	Basic formal education starts at age six years and lasts 12 years comprising eight years in primary school and four years in high school or secondary school.
1629	7902	Primary school is free in public schools and those who exit at this level can join a vocational youth/village polytechnic or make their own arrangements for an apprenticeship program and learn a trade such as tailoring, carpentry, motor vehicle repair, brick-laying and masonry for about two years.
1629	7903	Those who complete high school can join a polytechnic or other technical college and study for three years or proceed directly to the university and study for four years.
1629	7904	Graduates from the polytechnics and colleges can then join the workforce and later obtain a specialised higher diploma qualification after a further one to two years of training, or join the university – usually in the second or third year of their respective course.
1629	7905	The higher diploma is accepted by many employers in place of a bachelor's degree and direct or accelerated admission to post-graduate studies is possible in some universities.
1630	7906	The country's literacy level stands at 85% of the whole population.
1630	7907	Preschool, which targets children from age three to five, is an integral component of the education system and is a key requirement for admission to Standard One (First Grade).
1630	7908	At the end of primary education, pupils sit the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE), which determines those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training.
1630	7909	The result of this examination is needed for placement at secondary school.
1630	7910	Primary school age is 6/7-13/14 years.
1630	7911	For those who proceed to secondary level, there is a national examination at the end of Form Four – the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE), which determines those proceeding to the universities, other professional training or employment.
1630	7912	Students sit examinations in eight subjects of their choosing.
1630	7913	However, English, Kiswahili (languages) and mathematics are compulsory subjects.
1631	7914	Other than the curriculum led learning, there are also National and Public Library Services led by the Kenya National Library Service (KNLS).
1631	7915	KNLS is the body mandated to establish, equip, manage and maintain national and public libraries in the country.
1631	7916	In addition, some of the counties within the country have either established or taken over libraries within their regions.
1631	7917	Nairobi County operates four libraries within their network, which included the McMillan Memorial Library located at the central business district of Nairobi.
1631	7918	A public library is seen as a peoples university since it is open to all irrespective of age, literacy level and has materials relevant to people of all walks of life.
1632	7919	Kenya is active in several sports, among them cricket, rallying, football, rugby union and boxing.
1632	7920	The country is known chiefly for its dominance in middle-distance and long-distance athletics, having consistently produced Olympic and Commonwealth Games champions in various distance events, especially in 800 m, 1,500 m, 3,000 m steeplechase, 5,000 m, 10,000 m and the marathon.
1632	7921	Kenyan athletes (particularly Kalenjin) continue to dominate the world of distance running, although competition from Morocco and Ethiopia has reduced this supremacy.
1632	7922	Kenya's best-known athletes included the four-time women's Boston Marathon winner and two-time world champion Catherine Ndereba, 800m world record holder David Rudisha, former Marathon world record-holder Paul Tergat, and John Ngugi.
1633	7923	Kenya won several medals during the Beijing Olympics, six gold, four silver and four bronze, making it Africa's most successful nation in the 2008 Olympics.
1633	7924	New athletes gained attention, such as Pamela Jelimo, the women's 800m gold medalist who went ahead to win the IAAF Golden League jackpot, and Samuel Wanjiru who won the men's marathon.
1633	7925	Retired Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion Kipchoge Keino helped usher in Kenya's ongoing distance dynasty in the 1970s and was followed by Commonwealth Champion Henry Rono's spectacular string of world record performances.
1633	7926	Lately, there has been controversy in Kenyan athletics circles, with the defection of a number of Kenyan athletes to represent other countries, chiefly Bahrain and Qatar.
1633	7927	The Kenyan Ministry of Sports has tried to stop the defections, but they have continued anyway, with Bernard Lagat the latest, choosing to represent the United States.
1633	7928	Most of these defections occur because of economic or financial factors.
1633	7929	Some elite Kenyan runners who cannot qualify for their country's strong national team find it easier to qualify by running for other countries.
1634	7930	Kenya has been a dominant force in women's volleyball within Africa, with both the clubs and the national team winning various continental championships in the past decade.
1634	7931	[citation needed] The women's team has competed at the Olympics and World Championships but without any notable success.
1634	7932	Cricket is another popular and the most successful team sport.
1634	7933	Kenya has competed in the Cricket World Cup since 1996.
1634	7934	They upset some of the World's best teams and reached semi-finals of the 2003 tournament.
1634	7935	They won the inaugural World Cricket League Division 1 hosted in Nairobi and participated in the World T20.
1634	7936	Their current captain is Rakep Patel.
1634	7937	They participated in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011.
1634	7938	Kenya is represented by Lucas Onyango as a professional rugby league player who plays with Oldham Roughyeds.
1634	7939	Besides the former European Super League team, he has played for Widnes Vikings and rugby union with Sale Sharks.
1634	7940	Rugby union is increasing in popularity, especially with the annual Safari Sevens tournament.
1634	7941	Kenya sevens team ranked 9th in IRB Sevens World Series for the 2006 season.
1634	7942	Kenya was also a regional powerhouse in soccer.
1634	7943	However, its dominance has been eroded by wrangles within the now defunct Kenya Football Federation, leading to a suspension by FIFA which was lifted in March 2007.
1635	7944	In the motor rallying arena, Kenya is home to the world famous Safari Rally, commonly acknowledged as one of the toughest rallies in the world.
1635	7945	It was a part of the World Rally Championship for many years until its exclusion after the 2002 event owing to financial difficulties.
1635	7946	Some of the best rally drivers in the world have taken part in and won the rally, such as Björn Waldegård, Hannu Mikkola, Tommi Mäkinen, Shekhar Mehta, Carlos Sainz and Colin McRae.
1635	7947	Although the rally still runs annually as part of the Africa rally championship, the organisers are hoping to be allowed to rejoin the World Rally championship in the next couple of years.
1636	7948	Kenyans generally have three meals in a day – breakfast in the morning (kiamsha kinywa), lunch in the afternoon (chakula cha mchana) and supper in the evening (chakula cha jioni or known simply as "chajio").
1636	7949	In between, they have the 10 o'clock tea (chai ya saa nne) and 4 pm tea (chai ya saa kumi).
1636	7950	Breakfast is usually tea or porridge with bread, chapati, mahamri, boiled sweet potatoes or yams.
1636	7951	Ugali with vegetables, sour milk, meat, fish or any other stew is generally eaten by much of the population for lunch or supper.
1636	7952	Regional variations and dishes also exist.
1637	7953	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific intergovernmental body under the auspices of the United Nations, set up at the request of member governments.
1637	7954	It was first established in 1988 by two United Nations organizations, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and later endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly through Resolution 43/53.
1637	7955	Membership of the IPCC is open to all members of the WMO and UNEP.
1637	7956	The IPCC produces reports that support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is the main international treaty on climate change.
1637	7957	The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic [i.e., human-induced] interference with the climate system".
1637	7958	IPCC reports cover "the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation."
1638	7959	Korean economist Hoesung Lee is the chair of the IPCC since October 8, 2015, following the election of the new IPCC Bureau.
1638	7960	Before this election, the IPCC was led by his vice-Chair Ismail El Gizouli, who was designated acting Chair after the resignation of Rajendra K. Pachauri in February 2015.
1638	7961	The previous chairs were Rajendra K. Pachauri, elected in May 2002; Robert Watson in 1997; and Bert Bolin in 1988.
1638	7962	The chair is assisted by an elected bureau including vice-chairs, working group co-chairs, and a secretariat.
1639	7963	The IPCC Panel is composed of representatives appointed by governments and organizations.
1639	7964	Participation of delegates with appropriate expertise is encouraged.
1639	7965	Plenary sessions of the IPCC and IPCC Working groups are held at the level of government representatives.
1639	7966	Non Governmental and Intergovernmental Organizations may be allowed to attend as observers.
1639	7967	Sessions of the IPCC Bureau, workshops, expert and lead authors meetings are by invitation only.
1639	7968	Attendance at the 2003 meeting included 350 government officials and climate change experts.
1639	7969	After the opening ceremonies, closed plenary sessions were held.
1639	7970	The meeting report states there were 322 persons in attendance at Sessions with about seven-eighths of participants being from governmental organizations.
1640	7971	The IPCC receives funding through the IPCC Trust Fund, established in 1989 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Costs of the Secretary and of housing the secretariat are provided by the WMO, while UNEP meets the cost of the Depute Secretary.
1640	7972	Annual cash contributions to the Trust Fund are made by the WMO, by UNEP, and by IPCC Members; the scale of payments is determined by the IPCC Panel, which is also responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget.
1640	7973	The organisation is required to comply with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the WMO.
1641	7974	The IPCC does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data.
1641	7975	Lead authors of IPCC reports assess the available information about climate change based on published sources.
1641	7976	According to IPCC guidelines, authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources.
1641	7977	Authors may refer to non-peer-reviewed sources (the "grey literature"), provided that they are of sufficient quality.
1641	7978	Examples of non-peer-reviewed sources include model results, reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations, and industry journals.
1641	7979	Each subsequent IPCC report notes areas where the science has improved since the previous report and also notes areas where further research is required.
1642	7980	Each chapter has a number of authors who are responsible for writing and editing the material.
1642	7981	A chapter typically has two "coordinating lead authors", ten to fifteen "lead authors", and a somewhat larger number of "contributing authors".
1642	7982	The coordinating lead authors are responsible for assembling the contributions of the other authors, ensuring that they meet stylistic and formatting requirements, and reporting to the Working Group chairs.
1642	7983	Lead authors are responsible for writing sections of chapters.
1642	7984	Contributing authors prepare text, graphs or data for inclusion by the lead authors.
1643	7985	The executive summary of the WG I Summary for Policymakers report says they are certain that emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases, resulting on average in an additional warming of the Earth's surface.
1643	7986	They calculate with confidence that CO2 has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse effect.
1643	7987	They predict that under a "business as usual" (BAU) scenario, global mean temperature will increase by about 0.3 °C per decade during the [21st] century.
1643	7988	They judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6 °C over the last 100 years, broadly consistent with prediction of climate models, but also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability.
1643	7989	The unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect is not likely for a decade or more.
1644	7990	In 2001, 16 national science academies issued a joint statement on climate change.
1644	7991	The joint statement was made by the Australian Academy of Science, the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts, the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society of Canada, the Caribbean Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the French Academy of Sciences, the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina, the Indian National Science Academy, the Indonesian Academy of Sciences, the Royal Irish Academy, Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (Italy), the Academy of Sciences Malaysia, the Academy Council of the Royal Society of New Zealand, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the Royal Society (UK).
1644	7992	The statement, also published as an editorial in the journal Science, stated "we support the [TAR's] conclusion that it is at least 90% certain that temperatures will continue to rise, with average global surface temperature projected to increase by between 1.4 and 5.8 °C above 1990 levels by 2100".
1644	7993	The TAR has also been endorsed by the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences, Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society, and European Geosciences Union (refer to "Endorsements of the IPCC").
1645	7994	IPCC author Richard Lindzen has made a number of criticisms of the TAR.
1645	7995	Among his criticisms, Lindzen has stated that the WGI Summary for Policymakers (SPM) does not faithfully summarize the full WGI report.
1645	7996	For example, Lindzen states that the SPM understates the uncertainty associated with climate models.
1645	7997	John Houghton, who was a co-chair of TAR WGI, has responded to Lindzen's criticisms of the SPM.
1645	7998	Houghton has stressed that the SPM is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world's governments, and that any changes to the SPM must be supported by scientific evidence.
1646	7999	In addition to climate assessment reports, the IPCC is publishing Special Reports on specific topics.
1646	8000	The preparation and approval process for all IPCC Special Reports follows the same procedures as for IPCC Assessment Reports.
1646	8001	In the year 2011 two IPCC Special Report were finalized, the Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) and the Special Report on Managing Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX).
1646	8002	Both Special Reports were requested by governments.
1647	8003	The IPCC concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the UNFCCC process.
1647	8004	While the preparation of the assessment reports is a major IPCC function, it also supports other activities, such as the Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme, required under the UNFCCC.
1647	8005	This involves publishing default emission factors, which are factors used to derive emissions estimates based on the levels of fuel consumption, industrial production and so on.
1648	8006	This projection was not included in the final summary for policymakers.
1648	8007	The IPCC has since acknowledged that the date is incorrect, while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final summary was robust.
1648	8008	They expressed regret for "the poor application of well-established IPCC procedures in this instance".
1648	8009	The date of 2035 has been correctly quoted by the IPCC from the WWF report, which has misquoted its own source, an ICSI report "Variations of Snow and Ice in the past and at present on a Global and Regional Scale".
1649	8010	Former IPCC chairman Robert Watson has said "The mistakes all appear to have gone in the direction of making it seem like climate change is more serious by overstating the impact.
1649	8011	The IPCC needs to look at this trend in the errors and ask why it happened".
1649	8012	Martin Parry, a climate expert who had been co-chair of the IPCC working group II, said that "What began with a single unfortunate error over Himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance" and the IPCC had investigated the other alleged mistakes, which were "generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment".
1650	8013	The third assessment report (TAR) prominently featured a graph labeled "Millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction" based on a 1999 paper by Michael E. Mann, Raymond S. Bradley and Malcolm K. Hughes (MBH99), which has been referred to as the "hockey stick graph".
1650	8014	This graph extended the similar graph in Figure 3.20 from the IPCC Second Assessment Report of 1995, and differed from a schematic in the first assessment report that lacked temperature units, but appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years, and higher temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period than the mid 20th century.
1650	8015	The schematic was not an actual plot of data, and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England, with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of Medieval vineyards in England.
1650	8016	Even with this increase, the maximum it showed for the Medieval Warm Period did not reach temperatures recorded in central England in 2007.
1650	8017	The MBH99 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by Jones et al.
1650	8018	1998, Pollack, Huang & Shen 1998, Crowley & Lowery 2000 and Briffa 2000, using differing data and methods.
1650	8019	and Briffa reconstructions were overlaid with the MBH99 reconstruction in Figure 2.21 of the IPCC report.
1651	8020	These studies were widely presented as demonstrating that the current warming period is exceptional in comparison to temperatures between 1000 and 1900, and the MBH99 based graph featured in publicity.
1651	8021	Even at the draft stage, this finding was disputed by contrarians: in May 2000 Fred Singer's Science and Environmental Policy Project held a press event on Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C., featuring comments on the graph Wibjörn Karlén and Singer argued against the graph at a United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation hearing on 18 July 2000.
1651	8022	Contrarian John Lawrence Daly featured a modified version of the IPCC 1990 schematic, which he mis-identified as appearing in the IPCC 1995 report, and argued that "Overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report, the IPCC presented the 'Hockey Stick' as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt U-turn since its 1995 report".
1651	8023	Criticism of the MBH99 reconstruction in a review paper, which was quickly discredited in the Soon and Baliunas controversy, was picked up by the Bush administration, and a Senate speech by US Republican senator James Inhofe alleged that "manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people".
1651	8024	The data and methodology used to produce the "hockey stick graph" was criticized in papers by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by Wahl & Ammann 2007, which showed errors in the methods used by McIntyre and McKitrick.
1652	8025	On 23 June 2005, Rep. Joe Barton, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce wrote joint letters with Ed Whitfield, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations demanding full records on climate research, as well as personal information about their finances and careers, from Mann, Bradley and Hughes.
1652	8026	Sherwood Boehlert, chairman of the House Science Committee, said this was a "misguided and illegitimate investigation" apparently aimed at intimidating scientists, and at his request the U.S. National Academy of Sciences arranged for its National Research Council to set up a special investigation.
1652	8027	The National Research Council's report agreed that there were some statistical failings, but these had little effect on the graph, which was generally correct.
1652	8028	In a 2006 letter to Nature, Mann, Bradley, and Hughes pointed out that their original article had said that "more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached" and that the uncertainties were "the point of the article".
1653	8029	The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) published in 2007 featured a graph showing 12 proxy based temperature reconstructions, including the three highlighted in the 2001 Third Assessment Report (TAR); Mann, Bradley & Hughes 1999 as before, Jones et al.
1653	8030	1998 and Briffa 2000 had both been calibrated by newer studies.
1653	8031	In addition, analysis of the Medieval Warm Period cited reconstructions by Crowley & Lowery 2000 (as cited in the TAR) and Osborn & Briffa 2006.
1653	8032	Ten of these 14 reconstructions covered 1,000 years or longer.
1653	8033	Most reconstructions shared some data series, particularly tree ring data, but newer reconstructions used additional data and covered a wider area, using a variety of statistical methods.
1653	8034	The section discussed the divergence problem affecting certain tree ring data.
1654	8035	On 1 February 2007, the eve of the publication of IPCC's major report on climate, a study was published suggesting that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the maximum rates proposed during the last IPCC report in 2001.
1654	8036	The study compared IPCC 2001 projections on temperature and sea level change with observations.
1654	8037	Over the six years studied, the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by IPCC's 2001 projection, and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the IPCC projection.
1655	8038	Another example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the IPCC, far from overstating dangers and risks, have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels.
1655	8039	When the researchers' analysis was "applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0.5–1.4 m [50–140 cm] above 1990 levels.
1655	8040	These values are much greater than the 9–88 cm as projected by the IPCC itself in its Third Assessment Report, published in 2001".
1655	8041	This may have been due, in part, to the expanding human understanding of climate.
1656	8042	Michael Oppenheimer, a long-time participant in the IPCC and coordinating lead author of the Fifth Assessment Report conceded in Science Magazine's State of the Planet 2008-2009 some limitations of the IPCC consensus approach and asks for concurring, smaller assessments of special problems instead of the large scale approach as in the previous IPCC assessment reports.
1656	8043	It has become more important to provide a broader exploration of uncertainties.
1656	8044	Others see as well mixed blessings of the drive for consensus within the IPCC process and ask to include dissenting or minority positions or to improve statements about uncertainties.
1657	8045	The IPCC process on climate change and its efficiency and success has been compared with dealings with other environmental challenges (compare Ozone depletion and global warming).
1657	8046	In case of the Ozone depletion global regulation based on the Montreal Protocol has been successful, in case of Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol failed.
1657	8047	The Ozone case was used to assess the efficiency of the IPCC process.
1657	8048	The lockstep situation of the IPCC is having built a broad science consensus while states and governments still follow different, if not opposing goals.
1657	8049	The underlying linear model of policy-making of more knowledge we have, the better the political response will be is being doubted.
1658	8050	According to Sheldon Ungar's comparison with global warming, the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties.
1658	8051	The ozone case communicated to lay persons "with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture" and related to "immediate risks with everyday relevance", while the public opinion on climate change sees no imminent danger.
1658	8052	The stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts.
1658	8053	In case of the IPCC conclusions and the failure of the Kyoto Protocol, varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem.
1658	8054	In the UK, a report for a House of Lords committee asked to urge the IPCC to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the Stern Review ordered by the UK government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change.
1659	8055	Since the IPCC does not carry out its own research, it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies, and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report's final release.
1659	8056	In principle, this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an IPCC report cannot be included.
1659	8057	In an area of science where our scientific understanding is rapidly changing, this has been raised as a serious shortcoming in a body which is widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science.
1659	8058	However, there has generally been a steady evolution of key findings and levels of scientific confidence from one assessment report to the next.
1660	8059	In February 2010, in response to controversies regarding claims in the Fourth Assessment Report, five climate scientists – all contributing or lead IPCC report authors – wrote in the journal Nature calling for changes to the IPCC.
1660	8060	They suggested a range of new organizational options, from tightening the selection of lead authors and contributors, to dumping it in favor of a small permanent body, or even turning the whole climate science assessment process into a moderated "living" Wikipedia-IPCC.
1660	8061	Other recommendations included that the panel employ a full-time staff and remove government oversight from its processes to avoid political interference.
1661	8062	Chloroplasts' main role is to conduct photosynthesis, where the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll captures the energy from sunlight and converts it and stores it in the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH while freeing oxygen from water.
1661	8063	They then use the ATP and NADPH to make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process known as the Calvin cycle.
1661	8064	Chloroplasts carry out a number of other functions, including fatty acid synthesis, much amino acid synthesis, and the immune response in plants.
1661	8065	The number of chloroplasts per cell varies from 1 in algae up to 100 in plants like Arabidopsis and wheat.
1662	8066	Chloroplasts are highly dynamic—they circulate and are moved around within plant cells, and occasionally pinch in two to reproduce.
1662	8067	Their behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like light color and intensity.
1662	8068	Chloroplasts, like mitochondria, contain their own DNA, which is thought to be inherited from their ancestor—a photosynthetic cyanobacterium that was engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell.
1662	8069	Chloroplasts cannot be made by the plant cell and must be inherited by each daughter cell during cell division.
1663	8070	Chloroplasts are one of many types of organelles in the plant cell.
1663	8071	They are considered to have originated from cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis—when a eukaryotic cell engulfed a photosynthesizing cyanobacterium that became a permanent resident in the cell.
1663	8072	Mitochondria are thought to have come from a similar event, where an aerobic prokaryote was engulfed.
1663	8073	This origin of chloroplasts was first suggested by the Russian biologist Konstantin Mereschkowski in 1905 after Andreas Schimper observed in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resemble cyanobacteria.
1663	8074	Chloroplasts are only found in plants and algae.
1664	8075	Cyanobacteria are considered the ancestors of chloroplasts.
1664	8076	They are sometimes called blue-green algae even though they are prokaryotes.
1664	8077	They are a diverse phylum of bacteria capable of carrying out photosynthesis, and are gram-negative, meaning that they have two cell membranes.
1664	8078	Cyanobacteria also contain a peptidoglycan cell wall, which is thicker than in other gram-negative bacteria, and which is located between their two cell membranes.
1664	8079	Like chloroplasts, they have thylakoids within.
1664	8080	On the thylakoid membranes are photosynthetic pigments, including chlorophyll a. Phycobilins are also common cyanobacterial pigments, usually organized into hemispherical phycobilisomes attached to the outside of the thylakoid membranes (phycobilins are not shared with all chloroplasts though).
1665	8081	Somewhere around a billion years ago, a free-living cyanobacterium entered an early eukaryotic cell, either as food or as an internal parasite, but managed to escape the phagocytic vacuole it was contained in.
1665	8082	The two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium's gram negative cell wall, and not the phagosomal membrane from the host, which was probably lost.
1665	8083	The new cellular resident quickly became an advantage, providing food for the eukaryotic host, which allowed it to live within it.
1665	8084	Over time, the cyanobacterium was assimilated, and many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host.
1665	8085	Some of its proteins were then synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and imported back into the chloroplast (formerly the cyanobacterium).
1666	8086	These chloroplasts, which can be traced back directly to a cyanobacterial ancestor, are known as primary plastids ("plastid" in this context means almost the same thing as chloroplast).
1666	8087	All primary chloroplasts belong to one of three chloroplast lineages—the glaucophyte chloroplast lineage, the rhodophyte, or red algal chloroplast lineage, or the chloroplastidan, or green chloroplast lineage.
1666	8088	The second two are the largest, and the green chloroplast lineage is the one that contains the land plants.
1667	8089	The alga Cyanophora, a glaucophyte, is thought to be one of the first organisms to contain a chloroplast.
1667	8090	The glaucophyte chloroplast group is the smallest of the three primary chloroplast lineages, being found in only 13 species, and is thought to be the one that branched off the earliest.
1667	8091	Glaucophytes have chloroplasts that retain a peptidoglycan wall between their double membranes, like their cyanobacterial parent.
1667	8092	For this reason, glaucophyte chloroplasts are also known as muroplasts.
1667	8093	Glaucophyte chloroplasts also contain concentric unstacked thylakoids, which surround a carboxysome - an icosahedral structure that glaucophyte chloroplasts and cyanobacteria keep their carbon fixation enzyme rubisco in.
1667	8094	The starch that they synthesize collects outside the chloroplast.
1667	8095	Like cyanobacteria, glaucophyte chloroplast thylakoids are studded with light collecting structures called phycobilisomes.
1667	8096	For these reasons, glaucophyte chloroplasts are considered a primitive intermediate between cyanobacteria and the more evolved chloroplasts in red algae and plants.
1668	8097	Rhodoplasts have a double membrane with an intermembrane space and phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes on the thylakoid membranes, preventing their thylakoids from stacking.
1668	8098	Rhodoplasts have chlorophyll a and phycobilins for photosynthetic pigments; the phycobilin phycoerytherin is responsible for giving many red algae their distinctive red color.
1668	8099	However, since they also contain the blue-green chlorophyll a and other pigments, many are reddish to purple from the combination.
1668	8100	The red phycoerytherin pigment is an adaptation to help red algae catch more sunlight in deep water—as such, some red algae that live in shallow water have less phycoerytherin in their rhodoplasts, and can appear more greenish.
1668	8101	Rhodoplasts synthesize a form of starch called floridean, which collects into granules outside the rhodoplast, in the cytoplasm of the red alga.
1669	8102	The chloroplastidan chloroplasts, or green chloroplasts, are another large, highly diverse primary chloroplast lineage.
1669	8103	Their host organisms are commonly known as the green algae and land plants.
1669	8104	They differ from glaucophyte and red algal chloroplasts in that they have lost their phycobilisomes, and contain chlorophyll b instead.
1669	8105	Most green chloroplasts are (obviously) green, though some aren't, like some forms of Hæmatococcus pluvialis, due to accessory pigments that override the chlorophylls' green colors.
1669	8106	Chloroplastidan chloroplasts have lost the peptidoglycan wall between their double membrane, and have replaced it with an intermembrane space.
1669	8107	Some plants seem to have kept the genes for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer, though they've been repurposed for use in chloroplast division instead.
1670	8108	While primary chloroplasts have a double membrane from their cyanobacterial ancestor, secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside of the original two, as a result of the secondary endosymbiotic event, when a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed a chloroplast-containing alga but failed to digest it—much like the cyanobacterium at the beginning of this story.
1670	8109	The engulfed alga was broken down, leaving only its chloroplast, and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus, forming a chloroplast with three or four membranes—the two cyanobacterial membranes, sometimes the eaten alga's cell membrane, and the phagosomal vacuole from the host's cell membrane.
1671	8110	Euglenophytes are a group of common flagellated protists that contain chloroplasts derived from a green alga.
1671	8111	Euglenophyte chloroplasts have three membranes—it is thought that the membrane of the primary endosymbiont was lost, leaving the cyanobacterial membranes, and the secondary host's phagosomal membrane.
1671	8112	Euglenophyte chloroplasts have a pyrenoid and thylakoids stacked in groups of three.
1671	8113	Starch is stored in the form of paramylon, which is contained in membrane-bound granules in the cytoplasm of the euglenophyte.
1672	8114	Cryptophytes, or cryptomonads are a group of algae that contain a red-algal derived chloroplast.
1672	8115	Cryptophyte chloroplasts contain a nucleomorph that superficially resembles that of the chlorarachniophytes.
1672	8116	Cryptophyte chloroplasts have four membranes, the outermost of which is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
1672	8117	They synthesize ordinary starch, which is stored in granules found in the periplastid space—outside the original double membrane, in the place that corresponds to the red alga's cytoplasm.
1672	8118	Inside cryptophyte chloroplasts is a pyrenoid and thylakoids in stacks of two.
1673	8119	Apicomplexans are another group of chromalveolates.
1673	8120	Like the helicosproidia, they're parasitic, and have a nonphotosynthetic chloroplast.
1673	8121	They were once thought to be related to the helicosproidia, but it is now known that the helicosproida are green algae rather than chromalveolates.
1673	8122	The apicomplexans include Plasmodium, the malaria parasite.
1673	8123	Many apicomplexans keep a vestigial red algal derived chloroplast called an apicoplast, which they inherited from their ancestors.
1673	8124	Other apicomplexans like Cryptosporidium have lost the chloroplast completely.
1673	8125	Apicomplexans store their energy in amylopectin starch granules that are located in their cytoplasm, even though they are nonphotosynthetic.
1674	8126	Apicoplasts have lost all photosynthetic function, and contain no photosynthetic pigments or true thylakoids.
1674	8127	They are bounded by four membranes, but the membranes are not connected to the endoplasmic reticulum.
1674	8128	The fact that apicomplexans still keep their nonphotosynthetic chloroplast around demonstrates how the chloroplast carries out important functions other than photosynthesis.
1674	8129	Plant chloroplasts provide plant cells with many important things besides sugar, and apicoplasts are no different—they synthesize fatty acids, isopentenyl pyrophosphate, iron-sulfur clusters, and carry out part of the heme pathway.
1674	8130	This makes the apicoplast an attractive target for drugs to cure apicomplexan-related diseases.
1674	8131	The most important apicoplast function is isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis—in fact, apicomplexans die when something interferes with this apicoplast function, and when apicomplexans are grown in an isopentenyl pyrophosphate-rich medium, they dump the organelle.
1675	8132	The most common dinophyte chloroplast is the peridinin-type chloroplast, characterized by the carotenoid pigment peridinin in their chloroplasts, along with chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c2.
1675	8133	Peridinin is not found in any other group of chloroplasts.
1675	8134	The peridinin chloroplast is bounded by three membranes (occasionally two), having lost the red algal endosymbiont's original cell membrane.
1675	8135	The outermost membrane is not connected to the endoplasmic reticulum.
1675	8136	They contain a pyrenoid, and have triplet-stacked thylakoids.
1675	8137	Starch is found outside the chloroplast An important feature of these chloroplasts is that their chloroplast DNA is highly reduced and fragmented into many small circles.
1675	8138	Most of the genome has migrated to the nucleus, and only critical photosynthesis-related genes remain in the chloroplast.
1676	8139	The fucoxanthin dinophyte lineages (including Karlodinium and Karenia) lost their original red algal derived chloroplast, and replaced it with a new chloroplast derived from a haptophyte endosymbiont.
1676	8140	Karlodinium and Karenia probably took up different heterokontophytes.
1676	8141	Because the haptophyte chloroplast has four membranes, tertiary endosymbiosis would be expected to create a six membraned chloroplast, adding the haptophyte's cell membrane and the dinophyte's phagosomal vacuole.
1676	8142	However, the haptophyte was heavily reduced, stripped of a few membranes and its nucleus, leaving only its chloroplast (with its original double membrane), and possibly one or two additional membranes around it.
1677	8143	Members of the genus Dinophysis have a phycobilin-containing chloroplast taken from a cryptophyte.
1677	8144	However, the cryptophyte is not an endosymbiont—only the chloroplast seems to have been taken, and the chloroplast has been stripped of its nucleomorph and outermost two membranes, leaving just a two-membraned chloroplast.
1677	8145	Cryptophyte chloroplasts require their nucleomorph to maintain themselves, and Dinophysis species grown in cell culture alone cannot survive, so it is possible (but not confirmed) that the Dinophysis chloroplast is a kleptoplast—if so, Dinophysis chloroplasts wear out and Dinophysis species must continually engulf cryptophytes to obtain new chloroplasts to replace the old ones.
1678	8146	Some dinophytes, like Kryptoperidinium and Durinskia have a diatom (heterokontophyte) derived chloroplast.
1678	8147	These chloroplasts are bounded by up to five membranes, (depending on whether you count the entire diatom endosymbiont as the chloroplast, or just the red algal derived chloroplast inside it).
1678	8148	The diatom endosymbiont has been reduced relatively little—it still retains its original mitochondria, and has endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, a nucleus, and of course, red algal derived chloroplasts—practically a complete cell, all inside the host's endoplasmic reticulum lumen.
1678	8149	However the diatom endosymbiont can't store its own food—its starch is found in granules in the dinophyte host's cytoplasm instead.
1678	8150	The diatom endosymbiont's nucleus is present, but it probably can't be called a nucleomorph because it shows no sign of genome reduction, and might have even been expanded.
1678	8151	Diatoms have been engulfed by dinoflagellates at least three times.
1679	8152	Lepidodinium viride and its close relatives are dinophytes that lost their original peridinin chloroplast and replaced it with a green algal derived chloroplast (more specifically, a prasinophyte).
1679	8153	Lepidodinium is the only dinophyte that has a chloroplast that's not from the rhodoplast lineage.
1679	8154	The chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and has no nucleomorph—all the nucleomorph genes have been transferred to the dinophyte nucleus.
1679	8155	The endosymbiotic event that led to this chloroplast was serial secondary endosymbiosis rather than tertiary endosymbiosis—the endosymbiont was a green alga containing a primary chloroplast (making a secondary chloroplast).
1680	8156	While most chloroplasts originate from that first set of endosymbiotic events, Paulinella chromatophora is an exception that acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont more recently.
1680	8157	It is not clear whether that symbiont is closely related to the ancestral chloroplast of other eukaryotes.
1680	8158	Being in the early stages of endosymbiosis, Paulinella chromatophora can offer some insights into how chloroplasts evolved.
1680	8159	Paulinella cells contain one or two sausage shaped blue-green photosynthesizing structures called chromatophores, descended from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus.
1680	8160	Chromatophores cannot survive outside their host.
1680	8161	Chromatophore DNA is about a million base pairs long, containing around 850 protein encoding genes—far less than the three million base pair Synechococcus genome, but much larger than the approximately 150,000 base pair genome of the more assimilated chloroplast.
1680	8162	Chromatophores have transferred much less of their DNA to the nucleus of their host.
1680	8163	About 0.3–0.8% of the nuclear DNA in Paulinella is from the chromatophore, compared with 11–14% from the chloroplast in plants.
1681	8164	Chloroplasts have their own DNA, often abbreviated as ctDNA, or cpDNA.
1681	8165	It is also known as the plastome.
1681	8166	Its existence was first proved in 1962, and first sequenced in 1986—when two Japanese research teams sequenced the chloroplast DNA of liverwort and tobacco.
1681	8167	Since then, hundreds of chloroplast DNAs from various species have been sequenced, but they're mostly those of land plants and green algae—glaucophytes, red algae, and other algal groups are extremely underrepresented, potentially introducing some bias in views of "typical" chloroplast DNA structure and content.
1682	8168	The inverted repeat regions are highly conserved among land plants, and accumulate few mutations.
1682	8169	Similar inverted repeats exist in the genomes of cyanobacteria and the other two chloroplast lineages (glaucophyta and rhodophyceæ), suggesting that they predate the chloroplast, though some chloroplast DNAs have since lost or flipped the inverted repeats (making them direct repeats).
1682	8170	It is possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome, as chloroplast DNAs which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get rearranged more.
1683	8171	The mechanism for chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) replication has not been conclusively determined, but two main models have been proposed.
1683	8172	Scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s.
1683	8173	The results of the microscopy experiments led to the idea that chloroplast DNA replicates using a double displacement loop (D-loop).
1683	8174	As the D-loop moves through the circular DNA, it adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a Cairns replication intermediate, and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism.
1683	8175	Transcription starts at specific points of origin.
1683	8176	Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to transcribe the DNA.
1683	8177	As replication continues, the forks grow and eventually converge.
1683	8178	The new cpDNA structures separate, creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes.
1684	8179	In cpDNA, there are several A → G deamination gradients.
1684	8180	DNA becomes susceptible to deamination events when it is single stranded.
1684	8181	When replication forks form, the strand not being copied is single stranded, and thus at risk for A → G deamination.
1684	8182	Therefore, gradients in deamination indicate that replication forks were most likely present and the direction that they initially opened (the highest gradient is most likely nearest the start site because it was single stranded for the longest amount of time).
1684	8183	This mechanism is still the leading theory today; however, a second theory suggests that most cpDNA is actually linear and replicates through homologous recombination.
1684	8184	It further contends that only a minority of the genetic material is kept in circular chromosomes while the rest is in branched, linear, or other complex structures.
1685	8185	One of competing model for cpDNA replication asserts that most cpDNA is linear and participates in homologous recombination and replication structures similar to bacteriophage T4.
1685	8186	It has been established that some plants have linear cpDNA, such as maize, and that more species still contain complex structures that scientists do not yet understand.
1685	8187	When the original experiments on cpDNA were performed, scientists did notice linear structures; however, they attributed these linear forms to broken circles.
1685	8188	If the branched and complex structures seen in cpDNA experiments are real and not artifacts of concatenated circular DNA or broken circles, then a D-loop mechanism of replication is insufficient to explain how those structures would replicate.
1685	8189	At the same time, homologous recombination does not expand the multiple A --> G gradients seen in plastomes.
1685	8190	Because of the failure to explain the deamination gradient as well as the numerous plant species that have been shown to have circular cpDNA, the predominant theory continues to hold that most cpDNA is circular and most likely replicates via a D loop mechanism.
1686	8191	Endosymbiotic gene transfer is how we know about the lost chloroplasts in many chromalveolate lineages.
1686	8192	Even if a chloroplast is eventually lost, the genes it donated to the former host's nucleus persist, providing evidence for the lost chloroplast's existence.
1686	8193	For example, while diatoms (a heterokontophyte) now have a red algal derived chloroplast, the presence of many green algal genes in the diatom nucleus provide evidence that the diatom ancestor (probably the ancestor of all chromalveolates too) had a green algal derived chloroplast at some point, which was subsequently replaced by the red chloroplast.
1687	8194	Curiously, around half of the protein products of transferred genes aren't even targeted back to the chloroplast.
1687	8195	Many became exaptations, taking on new functions like participating in cell division, protein routing, and even disease resistance.
1687	8196	A few chloroplast genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome—most became nonfunctional pseudogenes, though a few tRNA genes still work in the mitochondrion.
1687	8197	Some transferred chloroplast DNA protein products get directed to the secretory pathway (though it should be noted that many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host's cell membrane, and therefore topologically outside of the cell, because to reach the chloroplast from the cytosol, you have to cross the cell membrane, just like if you were headed for the extracellular space.
1687	8198	In those cases, chloroplast-targeted proteins do initially travel along the secretory pathway).
1688	8199	After a chloroplast polypeptide is synthesized on a ribosome in the cytosol, an enzyme specific to chloroplast proteins phosphorylates, or adds a phosphate group to many (but not all) of them in their transit sequences.
1688	8200	Phosphorylation helps many proteins bind the polypeptide, keeping it from folding prematurely.
1688	8201	This is important because it prevents chloroplast proteins from assuming their active form and carrying out their chloroplast functions in the wrong place—the cytosol.
1688	8202	At the same time, they have to keep just enough shape so that they can be recognized by the chloroplast.
1688	8203	These proteins also help the polypeptide get imported into the chloroplast.
1689	8204	In land plants, chloroplasts are generally lens-shaped, 5–8 μm in diameter and 1–3 μm thick.
1689	8205	Greater diversity in chloroplast shapes exists among the algae, which often contain a single chloroplast that can be shaped like a net (e.g., Oedogonium), a cup (e.g., Chlamydomonas), a ribbon-like spiral around the edges of the cell (e.g., Spirogyra), or slightly twisted bands at the cell edges (e.g., Sirogonium).
1689	8206	Some algae have two chloroplasts in each cell; they are star-shaped in Zygnema, or may follow the shape of half the cell in order Desmidiales.
1689	8207	In some algae, the chloroplast takes up most of the cell, with pockets for the nucleus and other organelles (for example some species of Chlorella have a cup-shaped chloroplast that occupies much of the cell).
1690	8208	There are some common misconceptions about the outer and inner chloroplast membranes.
1690	8209	The fact that chloroplasts are surrounded by a double membrane is often cited as evidence that they are the descendants of endosymbiotic cyanobacteria.
1690	8210	This is often interpreted as meaning the outer chloroplast membrane is the product of the host's cell membrane infolding to form a vesicle to surround the ancestral cyanobacterium—which is not true—both chloroplast membranes are homologous to the cyanobacterium's original double membranes.
1691	8211	The chloroplast double membrane is also often compared to the mitochondrial double membrane.
1691	8212	This is not a valid comparison—the inner mitochondria membrane is used to run proton pumps and carry out oxidative phosphorylation across to generate ATP energy.
1691	8213	The only chloroplast structure that can considered analogous to it is the internal thylakoid system.
1691	8214	Even so, in terms of "in-out", the direction of chloroplast H+ ion flow is in the opposite direction compared to oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria.
1691	8215	In addition, in terms of function, the inner chloroplast membrane, which regulates metabolite passage and synthesizes some materials, has no counterpart in the mitochondrion.
1692	8216	The chloroplast membranes sometimes protrude out into the cytoplasm, forming a stromule, or stroma-containing tubule.
1692	8217	Stromules are very rare in chloroplasts, and are much more common in other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts in petals and roots, respectively.
1692	8218	They may exist to increase the chloroplast's surface area for cross-membrane transport, because they are often branched and tangled with the endoplasmic reticulum.
1692	8219	When they were first observed in 1962, some plant biologists dismissed the structures as artifactual, claiming that stromules were just oddly shaped chloroplasts with constricted regions or dividing chloroplasts.
1692	8220	However, there is a growing body of evidence that stromules are functional, integral features of plant cell plastids, not merely artifacts.
1693	8221	Some chloroplasts contain a structure called the chloroplast peripheral reticulum.
1693	8222	It is often found in the chloroplasts of C4 plants, though it has also been found in some C3 angiosperms, and even some gymnosperms.
1693	8223	The chloroplast peripheral reticulum consists of a maze of membranous tubes and vesicles continuous with the inner chloroplast membrane that extends into the internal stromal fluid of the chloroplast.
1693	8224	Its purpose is thought to be to increase the chloroplast's surface area for cross-membrane transport between its stroma and the cell cytoplasm.
1693	8225	The small vesicles sometimes observed may serve as transport vesicles to shuttle stuff between the thylakoids and intermembrane space.
1694	8226	Chloroplasts have their own ribosomes, which they use to synthesize a small fraction of their proteins.
1694	8227	Chloroplast ribosomes are about two-thirds the size of cytoplasmic ribosomes (around 17 nm vs 25 nm).
1694	8228	They take mRNAs transcribed from the chloroplast DNA and translate them into protein.
1694	8229	While similar to bacterial ribosomes, chloroplast translation is more complex than in bacteria, so chloroplast ribosomes include some chloroplast-unique features.
1694	8230	Small subunit ribosomal RNAs in several Chlorophyta and euglenid chloroplasts lack motifs for shine-dalgarno sequence recognition, which is considered essential for translation initiation in most chloroplasts and prokaryotes.
1694	8231	Such loss is also rarely observed in other plastids and prokaryotes.
1695	8232	Plastoglobuli (singular plastoglobulus, sometimes spelled plastoglobule(s)), are spherical bubbles of lipids and proteins about 45–60 nanometers across.
1695	8233	They are surrounded by a lipid monolayer.
1695	8234	Plastoglobuli are found in all chloroplasts, but become more common when the chloroplast is under oxidative stress, or when it ages and transitions into a gerontoplast.
1695	8235	Plastoglobuli also exhibit a greater size variation under these conditions.
1695	8236	They are also common in etioplasts, but decrease in number as the etioplasts mature into chloroplasts.
1696	8237	Plastoglobuli were once thought to be free-floating in the stroma, but it is now thought that they are permanently attached either to a thylakoid or to another plastoglobulus attached to a thylakoid, a configuration that allows a plastoglobulus to exchange its contents with the thylakoid network.
1696	8238	In normal green chloroplasts, the vast majority of plastoglobuli occur singularly, attached directly to their parent thylakoid.
1696	8239	In old or stressed chloroplasts, plastoglobuli tend to occur in linked groups or chains, still always anchored to a thylakoid.
1697	8240	The chloroplasts of some hornworts and algae contain structures called pyrenoids.
1697	8241	They are not found in higher plants.
1697	8242	Pyrenoids are roughly spherical and highly refractive bodies which are a site of starch accumulation in plants that contain them.
1697	8243	They consist of a matrix opaque to electrons, surrounded by two hemispherical starch plates.
1697	8244	The starch is accumulated as the pyrenoids mature.
1697	8245	In algae with carbon concentrating mechanisms, the enzyme rubisco is found in the pyrenoids.
1697	8246	Starch can also accumulate around the pyrenoids when CO2 is scarce.
1697	8247	Pyrenoids can divide to form new pyrenoids, or be produced "de novo".
1698	8248	In the helical thylakoid model, grana consist of a stack of flattened circular granal thylakoids that resemble pancakes.
1698	8249	Each granum can contain anywhere from two to a hundred thylakoids, though grana with 10–20 thylakoids are most common.
1698	8250	Wrapped around the grana are helicoid stromal thylakoids, also known as frets or lamellar thylakoids.
1698	8251	The helices ascend at an angle of 20–25°, connecting to each granal thylakoid at a bridge-like slit junction.
1698	8252	The helicoids may extend as large sheets that link multiple grana, or narrow to tube-like bridges between grana.
1698	8253	While different parts of the thylakoid system contain different membrane proteins, the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid space they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth.
1699	8254	Embedded in the thylakoid membranes are important protein complexes which carry out the light reactions of photosynthesis.
1699	8255	Photosystem II and photosystem I contain light-harvesting complexes with chlorophyll and carotenoids that absorb light energy and use it to energize electrons.
1699	8256	Molecules in the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, decreasing the pH and turning it acidic.
1699	8257	ATP synthase is a large protein complex that harnesses the concentration gradient of the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space to generate ATP energy as the hydrogen ions flow back out into the stroma—much like a dam turbine.
1700	8258	There are two types of thylakoids—granal thylakoids, which are arranged in grana, and stromal thylakoids, which are in contact with the stroma.
1700	8259	Granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks about 300–600 nanometers in diameter.
1700	8260	Stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana.
1700	8261	The flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat photosystem II protein complex.
1700	8262	This allows them to stack tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and surface area for light capture.
1701	8263	In addition to chlorophylls, another group of yellow–orange pigments called carotenoids are also found in the photosystems.
1701	8264	There are about thirty photosynthetic carotenoids.
1701	8265	They help transfer and dissipate excess energy, and their bright colors sometimes override the chlorophyll green, like during the fall, when the leaves of some land plants change color.
1701	8266	β-carotene is a bright red-orange carotenoid found in nearly all chloroplasts, like chlorophyll a. Xanthophylls, especially the orange-red zeaxanthin, are also common.
1701	8267	Many other forms of carotenoids exist that are only found in certain groups of chloroplasts.
1702	8268	Phycobilins are a third group of pigments found in cyanobacteria, and glaucophyte, red algal, and cryptophyte chloroplasts.
1702	8269	Phycobilins come in all colors, though phycoerytherin is one of the pigments that makes many red algae red.
1702	8270	Phycobilins often organize into relatively large protein complexes about 40 nanometers across called phycobilisomes.
1702	8271	Like photosystem I and ATP synthase, phycobilisomes jut into the stroma, preventing thylakoid stacking in red algal chloroplasts.
1702	8272	Cryptophyte chloroplasts and some cyanobacteria don't have their phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes, and keep them in their thylakoid space instead.
1703	8273	To fix carbon dioxide into sugar molecules in the process of photosynthesis, chloroplasts use an enzyme called rubisco.
1703	8274	Rubisco has a problem—it has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen, so at high oxygen concentrations, rubisco starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors.
1703	8275	This has the end result of ATP energy being wasted and CO2 being released, all with no sugar being produced.
1703	8276	This is a big problem, since O2 is produced by the initial light reactions of photosynthesis, causing issues down the line in the Calvin cycle which uses rubisco.
1704	8277	As a result, chloroplasts in C4 mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells are specialized for each stage of photosynthesis.
1704	8278	In mesophyll cells, chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions, so they lack rubisco, and have normal grana and thylakoids, which they use to make ATP and NADPH, as well as oxygen.
1704	8279	They store CO2 in a four-carbon compound, which is why the process is called C4 photosynthesis.
1704	8280	The four-carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath chloroplasts, where it drops off CO2 and returns to the mesophyll.
1704	8281	Bundle sheath chloroplasts do not carry out the light reactions, preventing oxygen from building up in them and disrupting rubisco activity.
1704	8282	Because of this, they lack thylakoids organized into grana stacks—though bundle sheath chloroplasts still have free-floating thylakoids in the stroma where they still carry out cyclic electron flow, a light-driven method of synthesizing ATP to power the Calvin cycle without generating oxygen.
1704	8283	They lack photosystem II, and only have photosystem I—the only protein complex needed for cyclic electron flow.
1704	8284	Because the job of bundle sheath chloroplasts is to carry out the Calvin cycle and make sugar, they often contain large starch grains.
1705	8285	Not all cells in a multicellular plant contain chloroplasts.
1705	8286	All green parts of a plant contain chloroplasts—the chloroplasts, or more specifically, the chlorophyll in them are what make the photosynthetic parts of a plant green.
1705	8287	The plant cells which contain chloroplasts are usually parenchyma cells, though chloroplasts can also be found in collenchyma tissue.
1705	8288	A plant cell which contains chloroplasts is known as a chlorenchyma cell.
1705	8289	A typical chlorenchyma cell of a land plant contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts.
1706	8290	In some plants such as cacti, chloroplasts are found in the stems, though in most plants, chloroplasts are concentrated in the leaves.
1706	8291	One square millimeter of leaf tissue can contain half a million chloroplasts.
1706	8292	Within a leaf, chloroplasts are mainly found in the mesophyll layers of a leaf, and the guard cells of stomata.
1706	8293	Palisade mesophyll cells can contain 30–70 chloroplasts per cell, while stomatal guard cells contain only around 8–15 per cell, as well as much less chlorophyll.
1706	8294	Chloroplasts can also be found in the bundle sheath cells of a leaf, especially in C4 plants, which carry out the Calvin cycle in their bundle sheath cells.
1706	8295	They are often absent from the epidermis of a leaf.
1707	8296	The chloroplasts of plant and algal cells can orient themselves to best suit the available light.
1707	8297	In low-light conditions, they will spread out in a sheet—maximizing the surface area to absorb light.
1707	8298	Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on.
1707	8299	This reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage.
1707	8300	This ability to distribute chloroplasts so that they can take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones.
1707	8301	Chloroplast movement is considered one of the most closely regulated stimulus-response systems that can be found in plants.
1707	8302	Mitochondria have also been observed to follow chloroplasts as they move.
1708	8303	Plants have two main immune responses—the hypersensitive response, in which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death, and systemic acquired resistance, where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen's presence.
1708	8304	Chloroplasts stimulate both responses by purposely damaging their photosynthetic system, producing reactive oxygen species.
1708	8305	High levels of reactive oxygen species will cause the hypersensitive response.
1708	8306	The reactive oxygen species also directly kill any pathogens within the cell.
1708	8307	Lower levels of reactive oxygen species initiate systemic acquired resistance, triggering defense-molecule production in the rest of the plant.
1709	8308	Chloroplasts can serve as cellular sensors.
1709	8309	After detecting stress in a cell, which might be due to a pathogen, chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense-signals.
1709	8310	As cellular signals, reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so they probably don't leave the chloroplast, but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule.
1709	8311	All these molecules initiate retrograde signaling—signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus.
1710	8312	One of the main functions of the chloroplast is its role in photosynthesis, the process by which light is transformed into chemical energy, to subsequently produce food in the form of sugars.
1710	8313	Water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are used in photosynthesis, and sugar and oxygen (O2) is made, using light energy.
1710	8314	Photosynthesis is divided into two stages—the light reactions, where water is split to produce oxygen, and the dark reactions, or Calvin cycle, which builds sugar molecules from carbon dioxide.
1710	8315	The two phases are linked by the energy carriers adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+).
1711	8316	Like mitochondria, chloroplasts use the potential energy stored in an H+, or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy.
1711	8317	The two photosystems capture light energy to energize electrons taken from water, and release them down an electron transport chain.
1711	8318	The molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a concentration gradient, with more hydrogen ions (up to a thousand times as many) inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma.
1711	8319	The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient, flowing back out into the stroma through ATP synthase.
1711	8320	ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.
1711	8321	Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, the ATP is synthesized there, in position to be used in the dark reactions.
1712	8322	While photosystem II photolyzes water to obtain and energize new electrons, photosystem I simply reenergizes depleted electrons at the end of an electron transport chain.
1712	8323	Normally, the reenergized electrons are taken by NADP+, though sometimes they can flow back down more H+-pumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more ATP.
1712	8324	This is termed cyclic photophosphorylation because the electrons are recycled.
1712	8325	Cyclic photophosphorylation is common in C4 plants, which need more ATP than NADPH.
1713	8326	The Calvin cycle starts by using the enzyme Rubisco to fix CO2 into five-carbon Ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) molecules.
1713	8327	The result is unstable six-carbon molecules that immediately break down into three-carbon molecules called 3-phosphoglyceric acid, or 3-PGA.
1713	8328	The ATP and NADPH made in the light reactions is used to convert the 3-PGA into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, or G3P sugar molecules.
1713	8329	Most of the G3P molecules are recycled back into RuBP using energy from more ATP, but one out of every six produced leaves the cycle—the end product of the dark reactions.
1714	8330	Alternatively, glucose monomers in the chloroplast can be linked together to make starch, which accumulates into the starch grains found in the chloroplast.
1714	8331	Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, these starch grains may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids.
1714	8332	The starch granules displace the thylakoids, but leave them intact.
1714	8333	Waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts, possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the plant cell).
1714	8334	This depletes a plant's free phosphate supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis.
1714	8335	While linked to low photosynthesis rates, the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency of photosynthesis, and might simply be a side effect of another photosynthesis-depressing factor.
1715	8336	Photorespiration can occur when the oxygen concentration is too high.
1715	8337	Rubisco cannot distinguish between oxygen and carbon dioxide very well, so it can accidentally add O2 instead of CO2 to RuBP.
1715	8338	This process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis—it consumes ATP and oxygen, releases CO2, and produces no sugar.
1715	8339	It can waste up to half the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle.
1715	8340	Several mechanisms have evolved in different lineages that raise the carbon dioxide concentration relative to oxygen within the chloroplast, increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis.
1715	8341	These mechanisms are called carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms, or CCMs.
1715	8342	These include Crassulacean acid metabolism, C4 carbon fixation, and pyrenoids.
1715	8343	Chloroplasts in C4 plants are notable as they exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism.
1716	8344	Chloroplasts alone make almost all of a plant cell's amino acids in their stroma except the sulfur-containing ones like cysteine and methionine.
1716	8345	Cysteine is made in the chloroplast (the proplastid too) but it is also synthesized in the cytosol and mitochondria, probably because it has trouble crossing membranes to get to where it is needed.
1716	8346	The chloroplast is known to make the precursors to methionine but it is unclear whether the organelle carries out the last leg of the pathway or if it happens in the cytosol.
1717	8347	Chloroplasts are a special type of a plant cell organelle called a plastid, though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.
1717	8348	There are many other types of plastids, which carry out various functions.
1717	8349	All chloroplasts in a plant are descended from undifferentiated proplastids found in the zygote, or fertilized egg.
1717	8350	Proplastids are commonly found in an adult plant's apical meristems.
1717	8351	Chloroplasts do not normally develop from proplastids in root tip meristems—instead, the formation of starch-storing amyloplasts is more common.
1718	8352	If angiosperm shoots are not exposed to the required light for chloroplast formation, proplastids may develop into an etioplast stage before becoming chloroplasts.
1718	8353	An etioplast is a plastid that lacks chlorophyll, and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma, called a prolamellar body.
1718	8354	While etioplasts lack chlorophyll, they have a yellow chlorophyll precursor stocked.
1718	8355	Within a few minutes of light exposure, the prolamellar body begins to reorganize into stacks of thylakoids, and chlorophyll starts to be produced.
1718	8356	This process, where the etioplast becomes a chloroplast, takes several hours.
1718	8357	Gymnosperms do not require light to form chloroplasts.
1719	8358	Plastid differentiation is not permanent, in fact many interconversions are possible.
1719	8359	Chloroplasts may be converted to chromoplasts, which are pigment-filled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in flowers and ripe fruit.
1719	8360	Starch storing amyloplasts can also be converted to chromoplasts, and it is possible for proplastids to develop straight into chromoplasts.
1719	8361	Chromoplasts and amyloplasts can also become chloroplasts, like what happens when a carrot or a potato is illuminated.
1719	8362	If a plant is injured, or something else causes a plant cell to revert to a meristematic state, chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into proplastids.
1719	8363	Chloroplast, amyloplast, chromoplast, proplast, etc., are not absolute states—intermediate forms are common.
1720	8364	The division process starts when the proteins FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 assemble into filaments, and with the help of a protein ARC6, form a structure called a Z-ring within the chloroplast's stroma.
1720	8365	The Min system manages the placement of the Z-ring, ensuring that the chloroplast is cleaved more or less evenly.
1720	8366	The protein MinD prevents FtsZ from linking up and forming filaments.
1720	8367	Another protein ARC3 may also be involved, but it is not very well understood.
1720	8368	These proteins are active at the poles of the chloroplast, preventing Z-ring formation there, but near the center of the chloroplast, MinE inhibits them, allowing the Z-ring to form.
1721	8369	Next, the two plastid-dividing rings, or PD rings form.
1721	8370	The inner plastid-dividing ring is located in the inner side of the chloroplast's inner membrane, and is formed first.
1721	8371	The outer plastid-dividing ring is found wrapped around the outer chloroplast membrane.
1721	8372	It consists of filaments about 5 nanometers across, arranged in rows 6.4 nanometers apart, and shrinks to squeeze the chloroplast.
1721	8373	This is when chloroplast constriction begins.
1721	8374	In a few species like Cyanidioschyzon merolæ, chloroplasts have a third plastid-dividing ring located in the chloroplast's intermembrane space.
1722	8375	Light has been shown to be a requirement for chloroplast division.
1722	8376	Chloroplasts can grow and progress through some of the constriction stages under poor quality green light, but are slow to complete division—they require exposure to bright white light to complete division.
1722	8377	Spinach leaves grown under green light have been observed to contain many large dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts.
1722	8378	Exposure to white light can stimulate these chloroplasts to divide and reduce the population of dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts.
1723	8379	Recently, chloroplasts have caught attention by developers of genetically modified crops.
1723	8380	Since, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent, transgenes in these plastids cannot be disseminated by pollen.
1723	8381	This makes plastid transformation a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks.
1723	8382	This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture.
1723	8383	While the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.
1724	8384	A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
1724	8385	A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number.
1724	8386	For example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6.
1724	8387	The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering.
1724	8388	The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 · 3, 1 · 1 · 3, etc.
1724	8389	are all valid factorizations of 3.
1725	8390	The property of being prime (or not) is called primality.
1725	8391	A simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division.
1725	8392	It consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and .
1725	8393	Algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers.
1725	8394	These include the Miller–Rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small probability of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical.
1725	8395	Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne numbers.
1725	8396	As of January 2016[update], the largest known prime number has 22,338,618 decimal digits.
1726	8397	There are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC.
1726	8398	There is no known simple formula that separates prime numbers from composite numbers.
1726	8399	However, the distribution of primes, that is to say, the statistical behaviour of primes in the large, can be modelled.
1726	8400	The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the probability that a given, randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, or to the logarithm of n.
1727	8401	Many questions regarding prime numbers remain open, such as Goldbach's conjecture (that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes), and the twin prime conjecture (that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2).
1727	8402	Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers.
1727	8403	Primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as public-key cryptography, which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors.
1727	8404	Prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains, mainly algebra, such as prime elements and prime ideals.
1728	8405	The image at the right illustrates that 12 is not prime: 12 = 3 · 4.
1728	8406	No even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition, any such number n has at least three distinct divisors, namely 1, 2, and n. This implies that n is not prime.
1728	8407	Accordingly, the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2.
1728	8408	Similarly, when written in the usual decimal system, all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9, since even numbers are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5.
1729	8409	Most early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number, so they could not consider it to be a prime.
1729	8410	By the Middle Ages and Renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number.
1729	8411	In the mid-18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with Leonhard Euler -- who did not agree.
1729	8412	In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime.
1729	8413	For example, Derrick Norman Lehmer's list of primes up to 10,006,721, reprinted as late as 1956, started with 1 as its first prime.
1729	8414	Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime.
1729	8415	By the early 20th century, mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number, but rather forms its own special category as a "unit".
1730	8416	A large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime, but Euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic (mentioned above) would not hold as stated.
1730	8417	For example, the number 15 can be factored as 3 · 5 and 1 · 3 · 5; if 1 were admitted as a prime, these two presentations would be considered different factorizations of 15 into prime numbers, so the statement of that theorem would have to be modified.
1730	8418	Similarly, the sieve of Eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime: a modified version of the sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 (that is, all other numbers) and produce as output only the single number 1.
1730	8419	Furthermore, the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks, such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function or the sum of divisors function.
1731	8420	There are hints in the surviving records of the ancient Egyptians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers: the Egyptian fraction expansions in the Rhind papyrus, for instance, have quite different forms for primes and for composites.
1731	8421	However, the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the Ancient Greeks.
1731	8422	Euclid's Elements (circa 300 BC) contain important theorems about primes, including the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
1731	8423	Euclid also showed how to construct a perfect number from a Mersenne prime.
1731	8424	The Sieve of Eratosthenes, attributed to Eratosthenes, is a simple method to compute primes, although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way.
1732	8425	After the Greeks, little happened with the study of prime numbers until the 17th century.
1732	8426	In 1640 Pierre de Fermat stated (without proof) Fermat's little theorem (later proved by Leibniz and Euler).
1732	8427	Fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n + 1 are prime (they are called Fermat numbers) and he verified this up to n = 4 (or 216 + 1).
1732	8428	However, the very next Fermat number 232 + 1 is composite (one of its prime factors is 641), as Euler discovered later, and in fact no further Fermat numbers are known to be prime.
1732	8429	The French monk Marin Mersenne looked at primes of the form 2p − 1, with p a prime.
1732	8430	They are called Mersenne primes in his honor.
1733	8431	The most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division.
1733	8432	This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n. If the result of any of these divisions is an integer, then n is not a prime, otherwise it is a prime.
1733	8433	Indeed, if  is composite (with a and b ≠ 1) then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most .
1733	8434	For example, for , the trial divisions are by m = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
1733	8435	None of these numbers divides 37, so 37 is prime.
1733	8436	This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to  is known—then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime.
1733	8437	For example, to check the primality of 37, only three divisions are necessary (m = 2, 3, and 5), given that 4 and 6 are composite.
1734	8438	Modern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes, probabilistic (or "Monte Carlo") and deterministic algorithms.
1734	8439	Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not.
1734	8440	For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite.
1734	8441	Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime.
1734	8442	These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way.
1734	8443	For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number.
1734	8444	If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime.
1734	8445	On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.
1735	8446	A particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the Fermat primality test, which relies on the fact (Fermat's little theorem) that np≡n (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number.
1735	8447	If we have a number b that we want to test for primality, then we work out nb (mod b) for a random value of n as our test.
1735	8448	A flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers (the Carmichael numbers) that satisfy the Fermat identity even though they are not prime, so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and Carmichael numbers.
1735	8449	Carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers, though, so this test can be useful for practical purposes.
1735	8450	More powerful extensions of the Fermat primality test, such as the Baillie-PSW, Miller-Rabin, and Solovay-Strassen tests, are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number.
1736	8451	Prime numbers of this form are known as factorial primes.
1736	8452	Other primes where either p + 1 or p − 1 is of a particular shape include the Sophie Germain primes (primes of the form 2p + 1 with p prime), primorial primes, Fermat primes and Mersenne primes, that is, prime numbers that are of the form 2p − 1, where p is an arbitrary prime.
1736	8453	The Lucas–Lehmer test is particularly fast for numbers of this form.
1736	8454	This is why the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime since the dawn of electronic computers.
1737	8455	The following table gives the largest known primes of the mentioned types.
1737	8456	Some of these primes have been found using distributed computing.
1737	8457	In 2009, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search project was awarded a US$100,000 prize for first discovering a prime with at least 10 million digits.
1737	8458	The Electronic Frontier Foundation also offers $150,000 and $250,000 for primes with at least 100 million digits and 1 billion digits, respectively.
1737	8459	Some of the largest primes not known to have any particular form (that is, no simple formula such as that of Mersenne primes) have been found by taking a piece of semi-random binary data, converting it to a number n, multiplying it by 256k for some positive integer k, and searching for possible primes within the interval [256kn + 1, 256k(n + 1) − 1].
1738	8460	are prime for any natural number n. Here  represents the floor function, i.e., largest integer not greater than the number in question.
1738	8461	The latter formula can be shown using Bertrand's postulate (proven first by Chebyshev), which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n − 2, for any natural number n > 3.
1738	8462	However, computing A or μ requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes to begin with.
1738	8463	Another formula is based on Wilson's theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once.
1739	8464	can have infinitely many primes only when a and q are coprime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is one.
1739	8465	If this necessary condition is satisfied, Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions asserts that the progression contains infinitely many primes.
1739	8466	The picture below illustrates this with q = 9: the numbers are "wrapped around" as soon as a multiple of 9 is passed.
1739	8467	The rows (=progressions) starting with a = 3, 6, or 9 contain at most one prime number.
1739	8468	In all other rows (a = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8) there are infinitely many prime numbers.
1739	8469	What is more, the primes are distributed equally among those rows in the long run—the density of all primes congruent a modulo 9 is 1/6.
1740	8470	The zeta function is closely related to prime numbers.
1740	8471	For example, the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function: if there were only finitely many primes then ζ(1) would have a finite value.
1740	8472	However, the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... diverges (i.e., exceeds any given number), so there must be infinitely many primes.
1740	8473	Another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern algebraic number theory is the following identity (Basel problem), due to Euler,
1741	8474	The unproven Riemann hypothesis, dating from 1859, states that except for s = −2, −4, ..., all zeroes of the ζ-function have real part equal to 1/2.
1741	8475	The connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible.
1741	8476	[clarification needed] From a physical viewpoint, it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise.
1741	8477	From a mathematical viewpoint, it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes (about x/log x of numbers less than x are primes, the prime number theorem) also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x (for intervals near x).
1741	8478	This hypothesis is generally believed to be correct.
1741	8479	In particular, the simplest assumption is that primes should have no significant irregularities without good reason.
1742	8480	In addition to the Riemann hypothesis, many more conjectures revolving about primes have been posed.
1742	8481	Often having an elementary formulation, many of these conjectures have withstood a proof for decades: all four of Landau's problems from 1912 are still unsolved.
1742	8482	One of them is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes.
1742	8483	As of February 2011[update], this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 · 1017.
1742	8484	Weaker statements than this have been proven, for example Vinogradov's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes.
1742	8485	Chen's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime, the product of two primes.
1742	8486	Also, any even integer can be written as the sum of six primes.
1742	8487	The branch of number theory studying such questions is called additive number theory.
1743	8488	A third type of conjectures concerns aspects of the distribution of primes.
1743	8489	It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes, pairs of primes with difference 2 (twin prime conjecture).
1743	8490	Polignac's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture, it states that for every positive integer n, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n.
1743	8491	It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1.
1743	8492	These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel's hypothesis H. Brocard's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2.
1743	8493	Legendre's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and (n + 1)2 for every positive integer n. It is implied by the stronger Cramér's conjecture.
1744	8494	For a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic with the exception of use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly.
1744	8495	In particular, number theorists such as British mathematician G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance.
1744	8496	However, this vision was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public key cryptography algorithms.
1744	8497	Prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.
1745	8498	Giuga's conjecture says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for p to be prime.
1745	8499	Another consequence of Fermat's little theorem is the following: if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1/p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p − 1 or a divisor of p − 1.
1745	8500	The fraction 1/p expressed likewise in base q (rather than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q. Wilson's theorem says that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p − 1)!
1745	8501	+ 1 is divisible by p. Moreover, an integer n > 4 is composite if and only if (n − 1)!
1746	8502	Several public-key cryptography algorithms, such as RSA and the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, are based on large prime numbers (for example, 512-bit primes are frequently used for RSA and 1024-bit primes are typical for Diffie–Hellman.).
1746	8503	RSA relies on the assumption that it is much easier (i.e., more efficient) to perform the multiplication of two (large) numbers x and y than to calculate x and y (assumed coprime) if only the product xy is known.
1746	8504	The Diffie–Hellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation, while the reverse operation the discrete logarithm is thought to be a hard problem.
1747	8505	The evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus Magicicada make use of prime numbers.
1747	8506	These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground.
1747	8507	They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most.
1747	8508	The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas.
1747	8509	If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them.
1747	8510	Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas.
1747	8511	Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects.
1748	8512	The concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics.
1748	8513	Generally, "prime" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense.
1748	8514	For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1.
1748	8515	It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name.
1748	8516	Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components.
1748	8517	For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots.
1748	8518	Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots.
1748	8519	Prime models and prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type.
1749	8520	Prime numbers give rise to two more general concepts that apply to elements of any commutative ring R, an algebraic structure where addition, subtraction and multiplication are defined: prime elements and irreducible elements.
1749	8521	An element p of R is called prime element if it is neither zero nor a unit (i.e., does not have a multiplicative inverse) and satisfies the following requirement: given x and y in R such that p divides the product xy, then p divides x or y.
1749	8522	An element is irreducible if it is not a unit and cannot be written as a product of two ring elements that are not units.
1749	8523	In the ring Z of integers, the set of prime elements equals the set of irreducible elements, which is
1750	8524	The fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains.
1750	8525	An example of such a domain is the Gaussian integers Z[i], that is, the set of complex numbers of the form a + bi where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers.
1750	8526	Its prime elements are known as Gaussian primes.
1750	8527	Not every prime (in Z) is a Gaussian prime: in the bigger ring Z[i], 2 factors into the product of the two Gaussian primes (1 + i) and (1 − i).
1750	8528	prime elements in Z) of the form 4k + 3 are Gaussian primes, whereas rational primes of the form 4k + 1 are not.
1751	8529	In ring theory, the notion of number is generally replaced with that of ideal.
1751	8530	Prime ideals, which generalize prime elements in the sense that the principal ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal, are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra, algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry.
1751	8531	The prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals (0), (2), (3), (5), (7), (11), … The fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the Lasker–Noether theorem, which expresses every ideal in a Noetherian commutative ring as an intersection of primary ideals, which are the appropriate generalizations of prime powers.
1752	8532	Prime ideals are the points of algebro-geometric objects, via the notion of the spectrum of a ring.
1752	8533	Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion, and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory.
1752	8534	For example, factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field, a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry.
1752	8535	Such ramification questions occur even in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers.
1752	8536	For example, prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity, a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations
1753	8537	In particular, this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by p, in sharp contrast to the usual absolute value (also referred to as the infinite prime).
1753	8538	While completing Q (roughly, filling the gaps) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers, completing with respect to the p-adic norm |−|p yields the field of p-adic numbers.
1753	8539	These are essentially all possible ways to complete Q, by Ostrowski's theorem.
1753	8540	Certain arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed (or local) fields.
1753	8541	This local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory.
1754	8542	Prime numbers have influenced many artists and writers.
1754	8543	The French composer Olivier Messiaen used prime numbers to create ametrical music through "natural phenomena".
1754	8544	In works such as La Nativité du Seigneur (1935) and Quatre études de rythme (1949–50), he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms: the primes 41, 43, 47 and 53 appear in the third étude, "Neumes rythmiques".
1754	8545	According to Messiaen this way of composing was "inspired by the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations".
1755	8546	The Rhine (Romansh: Rein, German: Rhein, French: le Rhin, Dutch: Rijn) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein border, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.
1755	8547	The biggest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany with a population of more than 1,050,000 people.
1755	8548	It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about 1,230 km (760 mi),[note 2][note 1] with an average discharge of about 2,900 m3/s (100,000 cu ft/s).
1756	8549	The variant forms of the name of the Rhine in modern languages are all derived from the Gaulish name Rēnos, which was adapted in Roman-era geography (1st century BC) as Greek Ῥῆνος (Rhēnos), Latin Rhenus.
1756	8550	[note 3] The spelling with Rh- in English Rhine as well as in German Rhein and French Rhin is due to the influence of Greek orthography, while the vocalisation -i- is due to the Proto-Germanic adoption of the Gaulish name as *Rīnaz, via Old Frankish giving Old English Rín, Old High German Rīn, Dutch Rijn (formerly also spelled Rhijn)).
1756	8551	The diphthong in modern German Rhein (also adopted in Romansh Rein, Rain) is a Central German development of the early modern period, the Alemannic name Rī(n) retaining the older vocalism,[note 4] as does Ripuarian Rhing, while Palatine has diphthongized Rhei, Rhoi.
1756	8552	Spanish is with French in adopting the Germanic vocalism Rin-, while Italian, Occitan and Portuguese retain the Latin Ren-.
1757	8553	The length of the Rhine is conventionally measured in "Rhine-kilometers" (Rheinkilometer), a scale introduced in 1939 which runs from the Old Rhine Bridge at Constance (0 km) to Hoek van Holland (1036.20 km).
1757	8554	The river length is significantly shortened from the river's natural course due to number of canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century.
1757	8555	[note 7] The "total length of the Rhine", to the inclusion of Lake Constance and the Alpine Rhine is more difficult to measure objectively; it was cited as 1,232 kilometres (766 miles) by the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat in 2010.
1758	8556	Near Tamins-Reichenau the Anterior Rhine and the Posterior Rhine join and form the Rhine.
1758	8557	The river makes a distinctive turn to the north near Chur.
1758	8558	This section is nearly 86 km long, and descends from a height of 599 m to 396 m. It flows through a wide glacial alpine valley known as the Rhine Valley (German: Rheintal).
1758	8559	Near Sargans a natural dam, only a few metres high, prevents it from flowing into the open Seeztal valley and then through Lake Walen and Lake Zurich into the river Aare.
1758	8560	The Alpine Rhine begins in the most western part of the Swiss canton of Graubünden, and later forms the border between Switzerland to the West and Liechtenstein and later Austria to the East.
1759	8561	The mouth of the Rhine into Lake Constance forms an inland delta.
1759	8562	The delta is delimited in the West by the Alter Rhein ("Old Rhine") and in the East by a modern canalized section.
1759	8563	Most of the delta is a nature reserve and bird sanctuary.
1759	8564	It includes the Austrian towns of Gaißau, Höchst and Fußach.
1759	8565	The natural Rhine originally branched into at least two arms and formed small islands by precipitating sediments.
1759	8566	In the local Alemannic dialect, the singular is pronounced "Isel" and this is also the local pronunciation of Esel ("Donkey").
1759	8567	Many local fields have an official name containing this element.
1760	8568	A regulation of the Rhine was called for, with an upper canal near Diepoldsau and a lower canal at Fußach, in order to counteract the constant flooding and strong sedimentation in the western Rhine Delta.
1760	8569	The Dornbirner Ach had to be diverted, too, and it now flows parallel to the canalized Rhine into the lake.
1760	8570	Its water has a darker color than the Rhine; the latter's lighter suspended load comes from higher up the mountains.
1760	8571	It is expected that the continuous input of sediment into the lake will silt up the lake.
1760	8572	This has already happened to the former Lake Tuggenersee.
1761	8573	Lake Constance consists of three bodies of water: the Obersee ("upper lake"), the Untersee ("lower lake"), and a connecting stretch of the Rhine, called the Seerhein ("Lake Rhine").
1761	8574	The lake is situated in Germany, Switzerland and Austria near the Alps.
1761	8575	Specifically, its shorelines lie in the German states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, and the Swiss cantons of Thurgau and St. Gallen.
1761	8576	The Rhine flows into it from the south following the Swiss-Austrian border.
1761	8577	It is located at approximately 47°39′N 9°19′E﻿ / ﻿47.650°N 9.317°E﻿ / 47.650; 9.317.
1762	8578	The flow of cold, gray mountain water continues for some distance into the lake.
1762	8579	The cold water flows near the surface and at first doesn't mix with the warmer, green waters of Upper Lake.
1762	8580	But then, at the so-called Rheinbrech, the Rhine water abruptly falls into the depths because of the greater density of cold water.
1762	8581	The flow reappears on the surface at the northern (German) shore of the lake, off the island of Lindau.
1762	8582	The water then follows the northern shore until Hagnau am Bodensee.
1762	8583	A small fraction of the flow is diverted off the island of Mainau into Lake Überlingen.
1762	8584	Most of the water flows via the Constance hopper into the Rheinrinne ("Rhine Gutter") and Seerhein.
1762	8585	Depending on the water level, this flow of the Rhine water is clearly visible along the entire length of the lake.
1763	8586	The Rhine emerges from Lake Constance, flows generally westward, as the Hochrhein, passes the Rhine Falls, and is joined by its major tributary, the river Aare.
1763	8587	The Aare more than doubles the Rhine's water discharge, to an average of nearly 1,000 m3/s (35,000 cu ft/s), and provides more than a fifth of the discharge at the Dutch border.
1763	8588	The Aare also contains the waters from the 4,274 m (14,022 ft) summit of Finsteraarhorn, the highest point of the Rhine basin.
1763	8589	The Rhine roughly forms the German-Swiss border from Lake Constance with the exceptions of the canton of Schaffhausen and parts of the cantons of Zürich and Basel-Stadt, until it turns north at the so-called Rhine knee at Basel, leaving Switzerland.
1764	8590	In the centre of Basel, the first major city in the course of the stream, is located the "Rhine knee"; this is a major bend, where the overall direction of the Rhine changes from West to North.
1764	8591	Legally, the Central Bridge is the boundary between High and Upper Rhine.
1764	8592	The river now flows North as Upper Rhine through the Upper Rhine Plain, which is about 300 km long and up to 40 km wide.
1764	8593	The most important tributaries in this area are the Ill below of Strasbourg, the Neckar in Mannheim and the Main across from Mainz.
1764	8594	In Mainz, the Rhine leaves the Upper Rhine Valley and flows through the Mainz Basin.
1765	8595	The Upper Rhine region was changed significantly by a Rhine straightening program in the 19th Century.
1765	8596	The rate of flow was increased and the ground water level fell significantly.
1765	8597	Dead branches dried up and the amount of forests on the flood plains decreased sharply.
1765	8598	On the French side, the Grand Canal d'Alsace was dug, which carries a significant part of the river water, and all of the traffic.
1765	8599	In some places, there are large compensation pools, for example the huge Bassin de compensation de Plobsheim in Alsace.
1766	8600	The Rhine is the longest river in Germany.
1766	8601	It is here that the Rhine encounters some more of its main tributaries, such as the Neckar, the Main and, later, the Moselle, which contributes an average discharge of more than 300 m3/s (11,000 cu ft/s).
1766	8602	Northeastern France drains to the Rhine via the Moselle; smaller rivers drain the Vosges and Jura Mountains uplands.
1766	8603	Most of Luxembourg and a very small part of Belgium also drain to the Rhine via the Moselle.
1766	8604	As it approaches the Dutch border, the Rhine has an annual mean discharge of 2,290 m3/s (81,000 cu ft/s) and an average width of 400 m (1,300 ft).
1767	8605	Between Bingen and Bonn, the Middle Rhine flows through the Rhine Gorge, a formation which was created by erosion.
1767	8606	The rate of erosion equaled the uplift in the region, such that the river was left at about its original level while the surrounding lands raised.
1767	8607	The gorge is quite deep and is the stretch of the river which is known for its many castles and vineyards.
1767	8608	It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site (2002) and known as "the Romantic Rhine", with more than 40 castles and fortresses from the Middle Ages and many quaint and lovely country villages.
1768	8609	Until the early 1980s, industry was a major source of water pollution.
1768	8610	Although many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine up into Switzerland, it is along the Lower Rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated, as the river passes the major cities of Cologne, Düsseldorf and Duisburg.
1768	8611	Duisburg is the home of Europe's largest inland port and functions as a hub to the sea ports of Rotterdam, Antwerp and Amsterdam.
1768	8612	The Ruhr, which joins the Rhine in Duisburg, is nowadays a clean river, thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls, a transition from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures, such as the reforestation of Slag and brownfields.
1768	8613	The Ruhr currently provides the region with drinking water.
1768	8614	It contributes 70 m3/s (2,500 cu ft/s) to the Rhine.
1768	8615	Other rivers in the Ruhr Area, above all, the Emscher, still carry a considerable degree of pollution.
1769	8616	The dominant economic sectors in the Middle Rhine area are viniculture and tourism.
1769	8617	The Rhine Gorge between Rüdesheim am Rhein and Koblenz is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
1769	8618	Near Sankt Goarshausen, the Rhine flows around the famous rock Lorelei.
1769	8619	With its outstanding architectural monuments, the slopes full of vines, settlements crowded on the narrow river banks and scores of castles lined up along the top of the steep slopes, the Middle Rhine Valley can be considered the epitome of the Rhine romanticism.
1770	8620	The Lower Rhine flows through North Rhine-Westphalia.
1770	8621	Its banks are usually heavily populated and industrialized, in particular the agglomerations Cologne, Düsseldorf and Ruhr area.
1770	8622	Here the Rhine flows through the largest conurbation in Germany, the Rhine-Ruhr region.
1770	8623	One of the most important cities in this region is Duisburg with the largest river port in Europe (Duisport).
1770	8624	The region downstream of Duisburg is more agricultural.
1770	8625	In Wesel, 30 km downstream of Duisburg, is located the western end of the second east-west shipping route, the Wesel-Datteln Canal, which runs parallel to the Lippe.
1770	8626	Between Emmerich and Cleves the Emmerich Rhine Bridge, the longest suspension bridge in Germany, crosses the 400 m wide river.
1770	8627	Near Krefeld, the river crosses the Uerdingen line, the line which separates the areas where Low German and High German are spoken.
1771	8628	From here, the situation becomes more complicated, as the Dutch name Rijn no longer coincides with the main flow of water.
1771	8629	Two thirds of the water flow volume of the Rhine flows farther west, through the Waal and then, via the Merwede and Nieuwe Merwede (De Biesbosch), merging with the Meuse, through the Hollands Diep and Haringvliet estuaries, into the North Sea.
1771	8630	The Beneden Merwede branches off, near Hardinxveld-Giessendam and continues as the Noord, to join the Lek, near the village of Kinderdijk, to form the Nieuwe Maas; then flows past Rotterdam and continues via Het Scheur and the Nieuwe Waterweg, to the North Sea.
1771	8631	The Oude Maas branches off, near Dordrecht, farther down rejoining the Nieuwe Maas to form Het Scheur.
1772	8632	The other third of the water flows through the Pannerdens Kanaal and redistributes in the IJssel and Nederrijn.
1772	8633	The IJssel branch carries one ninth of the water flow of the Rhine north into the IJsselmeer (a former bay), while the Nederrijn carries approximately two ninths of the flow west along a route parallel to the Waal.
1772	8634	However, at Wijk bij Duurstede, the Nederrijn changes its name and becomes the Lek.
1772	8635	It flows farther west, to rejoin the Noord River into the Nieuwe Maas and to the North Sea.
1773	8636	The name Rijn, from here on, is used only for smaller streams farther to the north, which together formed the main river Rhine in Roman times.
1773	8637	Though they retained the name, these streams no longer carry water from the Rhine, but are used for draining the surrounding land and polders.
1773	8638	From Wijk bij Duurstede, the old north branch of the Rhine is called Kromme Rijn ("Bent Rhine") past Utrecht, first Leidse Rijn ("Rhine of Leiden") and then, Oude Rijn ("Old Rhine").
1773	8639	The latter flows west into a sluice at Katwijk, where its waters can be discharged into the North Sea.
1773	8640	This branch once formed the line along which the Limes Germanicus were built.
1773	8641	During periods of lower sea levels within the various ice ages, the Rhine took a left turn, creating the Channel River, the course of which now lies below the English Channel.
1774	8642	The Rhine-Meuse Delta, the most important natural region of the Netherlands begins near Millingen aan de Rijn, close to the Dutch-German border with the division of the Rhine into Waal and Nederrijn.
1774	8643	Since the Rhine contributes most of the water, the shorter term Rhine Delta is commonly used.
1774	8644	However, this name is also used for the river delta where the Rhine flows into Lake Constance, so it is clearer to call the larger one Rhine-Meuse delta, or even Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta, as the Scheldt ends in the same delta.
1775	8645	The shape of the Rhine delta is determined by two bifurcations: first, at Millingen aan de Rijn, the Rhine splits into Waal and Pannerdens Kanaal, which changes its name to Nederrijn at Angeren, and second near Arnhem, the IJssel branches off from the Nederrijn.
1775	8646	This creates three main flows, two of which change names rather often.
1775	8647	The largest and southern main branch begins as Waal and continues as Boven Merwede ("Upper Merwede"), Beneden Merwede ("Lower Merwede"), Noord River ("North River"), Nieuwe Maas ("New Meuse"), Het Scheur ("the Rip") and Nieuwe Waterweg ("New Waterway").
1775	8648	The middle flow begins as Nederrijn, then changes into Lek, then joins the Noord, thereby forming Nieuwe Maas.
1775	8649	The northern flow keeps the name IJssel until it flows into Lake IJsselmeer.
1775	8650	Three more flows carry significant amounts of water: the Nieuwe Merwede ("New Merwede"), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Boven to Beneden Merwede; the Oude Maas ("Old Meuse"), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Beneden Merwede into Noord, and Dordtse Kil, which branches off from Oude Maas.
1776	8651	Before the St. Elizabeth's flood (1421), the Meuse flowed just south of today's line Merwede-Oude Maas to the North Sea and formed an archipelago-like estuary with Waal and Lek.
1776	8652	This system of numerous bays, estuary-like extended rivers, many islands and constant changes of the coastline, is hard to imagine today.
1776	8653	From 1421 to 1904, the Meuse and Waal merged further upstream at Gorinchem to form Merwede.
1776	8654	For flood protection reasons, the Meuse was separated from the Waal through a lock and diverted into a new outlet called "Bergse Maas", then Amer and then flows into the former bay Hollands Diep.
1777	8655	The hydrography of the current delta is characterized by the delta's main arms, disconnected arms (Hollandse IJssel, Linge, Vecht, etc.)
1777	8656	Many rivers have been closed ("dammed") and now serve as drainage channels for the numerous polders.
1777	8657	The construction of Delta Works changed the Delta in the second half of the 20th Century fundamentally.
1777	8658	Currently Rhine water runs into the sea, or into former marine bays now separated from the sea, in five places, namely at the mouths of the Nieuwe Merwede, Nieuwe Waterway (Nieuwe Maas), Dordtse Kil, Spui and IJssel.
1778	8659	The Rhine-Meuse Delta is a tidal delta, shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers, but also by tidal currents.
1778	8660	This meant that high tide formed a serious risk because strong tidal currents could tear huge areas of land into the sea.
1778	8661	Before the construction of the Delta Works, tidal influence was palpable up to Nijmegen, and even today, after the regulatory action of the Delta Works, the tide acts far inland.
1778	8662	At the Waal, for example, the most landward tidal influence can be detected between Brakel and Zaltbommel.
1779	8663	In southern Europe, the stage was set in the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era, with the opening of the Tethys Ocean, between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, between about 240 MBP and 220 MBP (million years before present).
1779	8664	The present Mediterranean Sea descends from this somewhat larger Tethys sea.
1779	8665	At about 180 MBP, in the Jurassic Period, the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods.
1779	8666	Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally, generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography: Iberia pushed up the Pyrenees; Italy, the Alps, and Anatolia, moving west, the mountains of Greece and the islands.
1779	8667	The compression and orogeny continue today, as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes.
1780	8668	From the Eocene onwards, the ongoing Alpine orogeny caused a N–S rift system to develop in this zone.
1780	8669	The main elements of this rift are the Upper Rhine Graben, in southwest Germany and eastern France and the Lower Rhine Embayment, in northwest Germany and the southeastern Netherlands.
1780	8670	By the time of the Miocene, a river system had developed in the Upper Rhine Graben, that continued northward and is considered the first Rhine river.
1780	8671	At that time, it did not yet carry discharge from the Alps; instead, the watersheds of the Rhone and Danube drained the northern flanks of the Alps.
1781	8672	Through stream capture, the Rhine extended its watershed southward.
1781	8673	By the Pliocene period, the Rhine had captured streams down to the Vosges Mountains, including the Mosel, the Main and the Neckar.
1781	8674	The northern Alps were then drained by the Rhone.
1781	8675	By the early Pleistocene period, the Rhine had captured most of its current Alpine watershed from the Rhône, including the Aar.
1781	8676	Since that time, the Rhine has added the watershed above Lake Constance (Vorderrhein, Hinterrhein, Alpenrhein; captured from the Rhône), the upper reaches of the Main, beyond Schweinfurt and the Vosges Mountains, captured from the Meuse, to its watershed.
1782	8677	Around 2.5 million years ago (ending 11,600 years ago) was the geological period of the Ice Ages.
1782	8678	Since approximately 600,000 years ago, six major Ice Ages have occurred, in which sea level dropped 120 m (390 ft) and much of the continental margins became exposed.
1782	8679	In the Early Pleistocene, the Rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present North Sea.
1782	8680	During the so-called Anglian glaciation (~450,000 yr BP, marine oxygen isotope stage 12), the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the English Channel.
1782	8681	This caused the Rhine's course to be diverted through the English Channel.
1782	8682	Since then, during glacial times, the river mouth was located offshore of Brest, France and rivers, like the Thames and the Seine, became tributaries to the Rhine.
1782	8683	During interglacials, when sea level rose to approximately the present level, the Rhine built deltas, in what is now the Netherlands.
1783	8684	The last glacial ran from ~74,000 (BP = Before Present), until the end of the Pleistocene (~11,600 BP).
1783	8685	In northwest Europe, it saw two very cold phases, peaking around 70,000 BP and around 29,000–24,000 BP.
1783	8686	The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum (Last Glacial Maximum).
1783	8687	During this time, the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest, through the English Channel and finally, to the Atlantic Ocean.
1783	8688	The English Channel, the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea were dry land, mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m (390 ft) lower than today.
1784	8689	Most of the Rhine's current course was not under the ice during the last Ice Age; although, its source must still have been a glacier.
1784	8690	A tundra, with Ice Age flora and fauna, stretched across middle Europe, from Asia to the Atlantic Ocean.
1784	8691	Such was the case during the Last Glacial Maximum, ca.
1784	8692	22,000–14,000 yr BP, when ice-sheets covered Scandinavia, the Baltics, Scotland and the Alps, but left the space between as open tundra.
1784	8693	The loess or wind-blown dust over that tundra, settled in and around the Rhine Valley, contributing to its current agricultural usefulness.
1785	8694	As northwest Europe slowly began to warm up from 22,000 years ago onward, frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fall-winter snow covers melted in spring.
1785	8695	Much of the discharge was routed to the Rhine and its downstream extension.
1785	8696	Rapid warming and changes of vegetation, to open forest, began about 13,000 BP.
1785	8697	By 9000 BP, Europe was fully forested.
1785	8698	With globally shrinking ice-cover, ocean water levels rose and the English Channel and North Sea re-inundated.
1785	8699	Meltwater, adding to the ocean and land subsidence, drowned the former coasts of Europe transgressionally.
1786	8700	Since 7500 yr ago, a situation with tides and currents, very similar to present has existed.
1786	8701	Rates of sea-level rise had dropped so far, that natural sedimentation by the Rhine and coastal processes together, could compensate the transgression by the sea; in the last 7000 years, the coast line was roughly at the same location.
1786	8702	In the southern North Sea, due to ongoing tectonic subsidence, the sea level is still rising, at the rate of about 1–3 cm (0.39–1.18 in) per century (1 metre or 39 inches in last 3000 years).
1787	8703	At the begin of the Holocene (~11,700 years ago), the Rhine occupied its Late-Glacial valley.
1787	8704	As a meandering river, it reworked its ice-age braidplain.
1787	8705	As sea-level continued to rise in the Netherlands, the formation of the Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta began (~8,000 years ago).
1787	8706	Coeval absolute sea-level rise and tectonic subsidence have strongly influenced delta evolution.
1787	8707	Other factors of importance to the shape of the delta are the local tectonic activities of the Peel Boundary Fault, the substrate and geomorphology, as inherited from the Last Glacial and the coastal-marine dynamics, such as barrier and tidal inlet formations.
1788	8708	Since ~3000 yr BP (= years Before Present), human impact is seen in the delta.
1788	8709	As a result of increasing land clearance (Bronze Age agriculture), in the upland areas (central Germany), the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up.
1788	8710	This caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta.
1788	8711	The shifting of river channels to new locations, on the floodplain (termed avulsion), was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta.
1788	8712	Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred.
1788	8713	Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining, for salt and fuel, from Roman times onward.
1788	8714	This was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11–13th century AD.
1788	8715	Thereafter, canals were dug, bends were short cut and groynes were built, to prevent the river's channels from migrating or silting up.
1789	8716	At present, the branches Waal and Nederrijn-Lek discharge to the North Sea, through the former Meuse estuary, near Rotterdam.
1789	8717	The river IJssel branch flows to the north and enters the IJsselmeer, formerly the Zuider Zee brackish lagoon; however, since 1932, a freshwater lake.
1789	8718	The discharge of the Rhine is divided among three branches: the River Waal (6/9 of total discharge), the River Nederrijn – Lek (2/9 of total discharge) and the River IJssel (1/9 of total discharge).
1789	8719	This discharge distribution has been maintained since 1709, by river engineering works, including the digging of the Pannerdens canal and since the 20th century, with the help of weirs in the Nederrijn river.
1790	8720	The Rhine was not known to Herodotus and first enters the historical period in the 1st century BC in Roman-era geography.
1790	8721	At that time, it formed the boundary between Gaul and Germania.
1790	8722	The Upper Rhine had been part of the areal of the late Hallstatt culture since the 6th century BC, and by the 1st century BC, the areal of the La Tène culture covered almost its entire length, forming a contact zone with the Jastorf culture, i.e.
1790	8723	the locus of early Celtic-Germanic cultural contact.
1790	8724	In Roman geography, the Rhine formed the boundary between Gallia and Germania by definition; e.g.
1790	8725	Maurus Servius Honoratus, Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil (8.727) (Rhenus) fluvius Galliae, qui Germanos a Gallia dividit "(The Rhine is a) river of Gaul, which divides the Germanic people from Gaul."
1791	8726	From the death of Augustus in AD 14 until after AD 70, Rome accepted as her Germanic frontier the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube.
1791	8727	Beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt, opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum (Mainz), the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridge-heads.
1791	8728	The northern section of this frontier, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell.
1791	8729	The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed.
1791	8730	The frontier which they form is inconveniently long, enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern Baden and Württemberg.
1791	8731	The Germanic populations of these lands seem in Roman times to have been scanty, and Roman subjects from the modern Alsace-Lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards.
1792	8732	The Romans kept eight legions in five bases along the Rhine.
1792	8733	The actual number of legions present at any base or in all, depended on whether a state or threat of war existed.
1792	8734	Between about AD 14 and 180, the assignment of legions was as follows: for the army of Germania Inferior, two legions at Vetera (Xanten), I Germanica and XX Valeria (Pannonian troops); two legions at oppidum Ubiorum ("town of the Ubii"), which was renamed to Colonia Agrippina, descending to Cologne, V Alaudae, a Celtic legion recruited from Gallia Narbonensis and XXI, possibly a Galatian legion from the other side of the empire.
1793	8735	Germanic tribes crossed the Rhine in the Migration period, by the 5th century establishing the kingdoms of Francia on the Lower Rhine, Burgundy on the Upper Rhine and Alemannia on the High Rhine.
1793	8736	This "Germanic Heroic Age" is reflected in medieval legend, such as the Nibelungenlied which tells of the hero Siegfried killing a dragon on the Drachenfels (Siebengebirge) ("dragons rock"), near Bonn at the Rhine and of the Burgundians and their court at Worms, at the Rhine and Kriemhild's golden treasure, which was thrown into the Rhine by Hagen.
1794	8737	By the 6th century, the Rhine was within the borders of Francia.
1794	8738	In the 9th, it formed part of the border between Middle and Western Francia, but in the 10th century, it was fully within the Holy Roman Empire, flowing through Swabia, Franconia and Lower Lorraine.
1794	8739	The mouths of the Rhine, in the county of Holland, fell to the Burgundian Netherlands in the 15th century; Holland remained contentious territory throughout the European wars of religion and the eventual collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, when the length of the Rhine fell to the First French Empire and its client states.
1794	8740	The Alsace on the left banks of the Upper Rhine was sold to Burgundy by Archduke Sigismund of Austria in 1469 and eventually fell to France in the Thirty Years' War.
1794	8741	The numerous historic castles in Rhineland-Palatinate attest to the importance of the river as a commercial route.
1795	8742	Since the Peace of Westphalia, the Upper Rhine formed a contentious border between France and Germany.
1795	8743	Establishing "natural borders" on the Rhine was a long-term goal of French foreign policy, since the Middle Ages, though the language border was – and is – far more to the west.
1795	8744	French leaders, such as Louis XIV and Napoleon Bonaparte, tried with varying degrees of success to annex lands west of the Rhine.
1795	8745	The Confederation of the Rhine was established by Napoleon, as a French client state, in 1806 and lasted until 1814, during which time it served as a significant source of resources and military manpower for the First French Empire.
1795	8746	In 1840, the Rhine crisis, prompted by French prime minister Adolphe Thiers's desire to reinstate the Rhine as a natural border, led to a diplomatic crisis and a wave of nationalism in Germany.
1796	8747	At the end of World War I, the Rhineland was subject to the Treaty of Versailles.
1796	8748	This decreed that it would be occupied by the allies, until 1935 and after that, it would be a demilitarised zone, with the German army forbidden to enter.
1796	8749	The Treaty of Versailles and this particular provision, in general, caused much resentment in Germany and is often cited as helping Adolf Hitler's rise to power.
1796	8750	The allies left the Rhineland, in 1930 and the German army re-occupied it in 1936, which was enormously popular in Germany.
1796	8751	Although the allies could probably have prevented the re-occupation, Britain and France were not inclined to do so, a feature of their policy of appeasement to Hitler.
1797	8752	In World War II, it was recognised that the Rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of Germany, by the Western Allies.
1797	8753	The Rhine bridge at Arnhem, immortalized in the book, A Bridge Too Far and the film, was a central focus of the battle for Arnhem, during the failed Operation Market Garden of September 1944.
1797	8754	The bridges at Nijmegen, over the Waal distributary of the Rhine, were also an objective of Operation Market Garden.
1797	8755	In a separate operation, the Ludendorff Bridge, crossing the Rhine at Remagen, became famous, when U.S. forces were able to capture it intact – much to their own surprise – after the Germans failed to demolish it.
1797	8756	This also became the subject of a film, The Bridge at Remagen.
1797	8757	Seven Days to the River Rhine was a Warsaw Pact war plan for an invasion of Western Europe during the Cold War.
1798	8758	Until 1932 the generally accepted length of the Rhine was 1,230 kilometres (764 miles).
1798	8759	In 1932 the German encyclopedia Knaurs Lexikon stated the length as 1,320 kilometres (820 miles), presumably a typographical error.
1798	8760	After this number was placed into the authoritative Brockhaus Enzyklopädie, it became generally accepted and found its way into numerous textbooks and official publications.
1798	8761	The error was discovered in 2010, and the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat confirms the length at 1,232 kilometres (766 miles).
1799	8762	Following a referendum in 1997, in which the Scottish electorate voted for devolution, the current Parliament was convened by the Scotland Act 1998, which sets out its powers as a devolved legislature.
1799	8763	The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliament – the areas in which it can make laws – by explicitly specifying powers that are "reserved" to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
1799	8764	The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster.
1799	8765	The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament, and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws.
1799	8766	The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999.
1800	8767	For the next three hundred years, Scotland was directly governed by the Parliament of Great Britain and the subsequent Parliament of the United Kingdom, both seated at Westminster, and the lack of a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in Scottish national identity.
1800	8768	Suggestions for a 'devolved' Parliament were made before 1914, but were shelved due to the outbreak of the First World War.
1800	8769	A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence, and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution.
1800	8770	One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom.
1800	8771	Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs.
1801	8772	During this time, the discovery of oil in the North Sea and the following "It's Scotland's oil" campaign of the Scottish National Party (SNP) resulted in rising support for Scottish independence, as well as the SNP.
1801	8773	The party argued that the revenues from the oil were not benefitting Scotland as much as they should.
1801	8774	The combined effect of these events led to Prime Minister Wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974.
1801	8775	However, it was not until 1978 that final legislative proposals for a Scottish Assembly were passed by the United Kingdom Parliament.
1802	8776	Under the terms of the Scotland Act 1978, an elected assembly would be set up in Edinburgh provided that the majority of the Scottish electorate voted for it in a referendum to be held on 1 March 1979 that represented at least 40% of the total electorate.
1802	8777	The 1979 Scottish devolution referendum to establish a devolved Scottish Assembly failed.
1802	8778	Although the vote was 51.6% in favour of a Scottish Assembly, this figure did not equal the 40% of the total electorate threshold deemed necessary to pass the measure, as 32.9% of the eligible voting population did not, or had been unable to, vote.
1803	8779	Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, demand for a Scottish Parliament grew, in part because the government of the United Kingdom was controlled by the Conservative Party, while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs.
1803	8780	In the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was initiated as a pressure group, leading to the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention with various organisations such as Scottish churches, political parties and representatives of industry taking part.
1803	8781	Publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995, the Convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament.
1804	8782	Since September 2004, the official home of the Scottish Parliament has been a new Scottish Parliament Building, in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh.
1804	8783	The Scottish Parliament building was designed by Spanish architect Enric Miralles in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle.
1804	8784	Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings.
1804	8785	Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on Raeburn's Skating Minister.
1804	8786	Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture.
1804	8787	Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004.
1805	8788	Whilst the permanent building at Holyrood was being constructed, the Parliament's temporary home was the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.
1805	8789	Official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the Assembly Hall, which is part of the School of Divinity of the University of Edinburgh.
1805	8790	This building was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the Church's General Assembly.
1805	8791	In May 2000, the Parliament was temporarily relocated to the former Strathclyde Regional Council debating chamber in Glasgow, and to the University of Aberdeen in May 2002.
1806	8792	In addition to the General Assembly Hall, the Parliament also used buildings rented from the City of Edinburgh Council.
1806	8793	The former administrative building of Lothian Regional Council on George IV Bridge was used for the MSP's offices.
1806	8794	Following the move to Holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished.
1806	8795	The former Midlothian County Buildings facing Parliament Square, High Street and George IV Bridge in Edinburgh (originally built as the headquarters of the pre-1975 Midlothian County Council) housed the Parliament's visitors' centre and shop, whilst the main hall was used as the Parliament's principal committee room.
1807	8796	After each election to the Scottish Parliament, at the beginning of each parliamentary session, Parliament elects one MSP to serve as Presiding Officer, the equivalent of the speaker (currently Tricia Marwick), and two MSPs to serve as deputies (currently Elaine Smith and John Scott).
1807	8797	The Presiding Officer and deputies are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 MSPs, which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament.
1807	8798	Principally, the role of the Presiding Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body.
1807	8799	When chairing meetings of the Parliament, the Presiding Officer and his/her deputies must be politically impartial.
1807	8800	During debates, the Presiding Officer (or the deputy) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks, who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings.
1807	8801	A vote clerk sits in front of the Presiding Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.
1808	8802	As a member of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Presiding Officer is responsible for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff, property and resources it requires to operate.
1808	8803	Convening the Parliamentary Bureau, which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber, is another of the roles of the Presiding Officer.
1808	8804	Under the Standing Orders of the Parliament the Bureau consists of the Presiding Officer and one representative from each political parties with five or more seats in the Parliament.
1808	8805	Amongst the duties of the Bureau are to agree the timetable of business in the chamber, establish the number, remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation (bills) through the Parliament.
1808	8806	The Presiding Officer also represents the Scottish Parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity.
1809	8807	The debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament has seating arranged in a hemicycle, which reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members.
1809	8808	There are 131 seats in the debating chamber.
1809	8809	Of the total 131 seats, 129 are occupied by the Parliament's elected MSPs and 2 are seats for the Scottish Law Officers – the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland, who are not elected members of the Parliament but are members of the Scottish Government.
1809	8810	As such the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but, as they are not elected MSPs, cannot vote.
1809	8811	Members are able to sit anywhere in the debating chamber, but typically sit in their party groupings.
1809	8812	The First Minister, Scottish cabinet ministers and Law officers sit in the front row, in the middle section of the chamber.
1809	8813	The largest party in the Parliament sits in the middle of the semicircle, with opposing parties on either side.
1809	8814	The Presiding Officer, parliamentary clerks and officials sit opposite members at the front of the debating chamber.
1810	8815	In front of the Presiding Officers' desk is the parliamentary mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity.
1810	8816	The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around the head of the mace, which has a formal ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, reinforcing the authority of the Parliament in its ability to make laws.
1810	8817	Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon its official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case suspended from the lid.
1810	8818	At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.
1811	8819	Parliament typically sits Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from early January to late June and from early September to mid December, with two-week recesses in April and October.
1811	8820	Plenary meetings in the debating chamber usually take place on Wednesday afternoons from 2 pm to 6 pm and on Thursdays from 9:15 am to 6 pm.
1811	8821	Chamber debates and committee meetings are open to the public.
1811	8822	Entry is free, but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space.
1811	8823	Meetings are broadcast on the Parliament's own channel Holyrood.tv and on the BBC's parliamentary channel BBC Parliament.
1811	8824	Proceedings are also recorded in text form, in print and online, in the Official Report, which is the substantially verbatim transcript of parliamentary debates.
1812	8825	The first item of business on Wednesdays is usually Time for Reflection, at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes, sharing a perspective on issues of faith.
1812	8826	This contrasts with the formal style of "Prayers", which is the first item of business in meetings of the House of Commons.
1812	8827	Speakers are drawn from across Scotland and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs according to the Scottish census.
1812	8828	Invitations to address Parliament in this manner are determined by the Presiding Officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau.
1812	8829	Faith groups can make direct representations to the Presiding Officer to nominate speakers.
1813	8830	The Presiding Officer (or Deputy Presiding Officer) decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak.
1813	8831	Normally, the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak.
1813	8832	Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time.
1813	8833	The Presiding Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate.
1813	8834	Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems.
1813	8835	Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping is allowed.
1813	8836	Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use Scots, Gaelic, or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer.
1813	8837	The Scottish Parliament has conducted debates in the Gaelic language.
1814	8838	Each sitting day, normally at 5 pm, MSPs decide on all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day.
1814	8839	This "Decision Time" is heralded by the sounding of the division bell, which is heard throughout the Parliamentary campus and alerts MSPs who are not in the chamber to return and vote.
1814	8840	At Decision Time, the Presiding Officer puts questions on the motions and amendments by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking "Are we all agreed?
1814	8841	", to which the chamber first votes orally.
1814	8842	If there is audible dissent, the Presiding Officer announces "There will be a division" and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks.
1814	8843	Each MSP has a unique access card with a microchip which, when inserted into the console, identifies them and allows them to vote.
1814	8844	As a result, the outcome of each division is known in seconds.
1815	8845	The outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote.
1815	8846	Parties entrust some MSPs, known as whips, with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line.
1815	8847	MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties.
1815	8848	Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright.
1815	8849	Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party's policies are rare.
1815	8850	In some circumstances, however, parties announce "free votes", which allows Members to vote as they please.
1815	8851	This is typically done on moral issues.
1816	8852	Immediately after Decision Time a "Members Debate" is held, which lasts for 45 minutes.
1816	8853	Members Business is a debate on a motion proposed by an MSP who is not a Scottish minister.
1816	8854	Such motions are on issues which may be of interest to a particular area such as a member's own constituency, an upcoming or past event or any other item which would otherwise not be accorded official parliamentary time.
1816	8855	As well as the proposer, other members normally contribute to the debate.
1816	8856	The relevant minister, whose department the debate and motion relate to "winds up" the debate by speaking after all other participants.
1817	8857	Much of the work of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee.
1817	8858	The role of committees is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the fact that there is no revising chamber.
1817	8859	The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation.
1817	8860	Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting.
1817	8861	Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.
1818	8862	Committees comprise a small number of MSPs, with membership reflecting the balance of parties across Parliament.
1818	8863	There are different committees with their functions set out in different ways.
1818	8864	Mandatory Committees are committees which are set down under the Scottish Parliament's standing orders, which govern their remits and proceedings.
1818	8865	The current Mandatory Committees in the fourth Session of the Scottish Parliament are: Public Audit; Equal Opportunities; European and External Relations; Finance; Public Petitions; Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments; and Delegated Powers and Law Reform.
1819	8866	Subject Committees are established at the beginning of each parliamentary session, and again the members on each committee reflect the balance of parties across Parliament.
1819	8867	Typically each committee corresponds with one (or more) of the departments (or ministries) of the Scottish Government.
1819	8868	The current Subject Committees in the fourth Session are: Economy, Energy and Tourism; Education and Culture; Health and Sport; Justice; Local Government and Regeneration; Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment; Welfare Reform; and Infrastructure and Capital Investment.
1820	8869	A further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government.
1820	8870	Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property.
1820	8871	Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.
1821	8872	The Scotland Act 1998, which was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and given royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II on 19 November 1998, governs the functions and role of the Scottish Parliament and delimits its legislative competence.
1821	8873	The Scotland Act 2012 extends the devolved competencies.
1821	8874	For the purposes of parliamentary sovereignty, the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster continues to constitute the supreme legislature of Scotland.
1821	8875	However, under the terms of the Scotland Act, Westminster agreed to devolve some of its responsibilities over Scottish domestic policy to the Scottish Parliament.
1821	8876	Such "devolved matters" include education, health, agriculture and justice.
1821	8877	The Scotland Act enabled the Scottish Parliament to pass primary legislation on these issues.
1821	8878	A degree of domestic authority, and all foreign policy, remain with the UK Parliament in Westminster.
1821	8879	The Scottish Parliament has the power to pass laws and has limited tax-varying capability.
1821	8880	Another of the roles of the Parliament is to hold the Scottish Government to account.
1822	8881	The specific devolved matters are all subjects which are not explicitly stated in Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act as reserved matters.
1822	8882	All matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the Scottish Parliament.
1822	8883	Most importantly, this includes agriculture, fisheries and forestry, economic development, education, environment, food standards, health, home affairs, Scots law – courts, police and fire services, local government, sport and the arts, transport, training, tourism, research and statistics and social work.
1822	8884	The Scottish Parliament has the ability to alter income tax in Scotland by up to 3 pence in the pound.
1822	8885	The 2012 Act conferred further fiscal devolution including borrowing powers and some other unconnected matters such as setting speed limits and control of air guns.
1823	8886	Reserved matters are subjects that are outside the legislative competence of the Scotland Parliament.
1823	8887	The Scottish Parliament is unable to legislate on such issues that are reserved to, and dealt with at, Westminster (and where Ministerial functions usually lie with UK Government ministers).
1823	8888	These include abortion, broadcasting policy, civil service, common markets for UK goods and services, constitution, electricity, coal, oil, gas, nuclear energy, defence and national security, drug policy, employment, foreign policy and relations with Europe, most aspects of transport safety and regulation, National Lottery, protection of borders, social security and stability of UK's fiscal, economic and monetary system.
1824	8889	Bills can be introduced to Parliament in a number of ways; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill; a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member; or a private bill can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer.
1824	8890	Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party.
1824	8891	Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages:
1825	8892	Stage 1 is the first, or introductory stage of the bill, where the minister or member in charge of the bill will formally introduce it to Parliament together with its accompanying documents – Explanatory Notes, a Policy Memorandum setting out the policy underlying the bill, and a Financial Memorandum setting out the costs and savings associated with it.
1825	8893	Statements from the Presiding Officer and the member in charge of the bill are also lodged indicating whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the Parliament.
1825	8894	Stage 1 usually takes place, initially, in the relevant committee or committees and is then submitted to the whole Parliament for a full debate in the chamber on the general principles of the bill.
1825	8895	If the whole Parliament agrees in a vote to the general principles of the bill, it then proceeds to Stage 2.
1826	8896	Stage 3 is the final stage of the bill and is considered at a meeting of the whole Parliament.
1826	8897	This stage comprises two parts: consideration of amendments to the bill as a general debate, and a final vote on the bill.
1826	8898	Opposition members can table "wrecking amendments" to the bill, designed to thwart further progress and take up parliamentary time, to cause the bill to fall without a final vote being taken.
1826	8899	After a general debate on the final form of the bill, members proceed to vote at Decision Time on whether they agree to the general principles of the final bill.
1827	8900	Royal assent: After the bill has been passed, the Presiding Officer submits it to the Monarch for royal assent and it becomes an Act of the Scottish Parliament.
1827	8901	However he cannot do so until a 4-week period has elapsed, during which the Law Officers of the Scottish Government or UK Government can refer the bill to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom for a ruling on whether it is within the powers of the Parliament.
1827	8902	Acts of the Scottish Parliament do not begin with a conventional enacting formula.
1827	8903	Instead they begin with a phrase that reads: "The Bill for this Act of the Scottish Parliament was passed by the Parliament on [Date] and received royal assent on [Date]".
1828	8904	The party, or parties, that hold the majority of seats in the Parliament forms the Scottish Government.
1828	8905	In contrast to many other parliamentary systems, Parliament elects a First Minister from a number of candidates at the beginning of each parliamentary term (after a general election).
1828	8906	Any member can put their name forward to be First Minister, and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament.
1828	8907	Normally, the leader of the largest party is returned as First Minister, and head of the Scottish Government.
1828	8908	Theoretically, Parliament also elects the Scottish Ministers who form the government of Scotland and sit in the Scottish cabinet, but such ministers are, in practice, appointed to their roles by the First Minister.
1828	8909	Junior ministers, who do not attend cabinet, are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments.
1828	8910	Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs, with the exception of Scotland's Chief Law Officers: the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General.
1828	8911	Whilst the First Minister chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the Sovereign.
1829	8912	Under the Scotland Act 1998, ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on).
1829	8913	The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the Monarch on the proposal of the Presiding Officer.
1829	8914	If the Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation.
1829	8915	Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it.
1829	8916	The following ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May, a multiple of four years after 1999 (i.e., 5 May 2011, 7 May 2015, etc.
1830	8917	Several procedures enable the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government.
1830	8918	The First Minister or members of the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question.
1830	8919	For example, at the beginning of each parliamentary year, the First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year.
1830	8920	After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement.
1831	8921	Parliamentary time is also set aside for question periods in the debating chamber.
1831	8922	A "General Question Time" takes place on a Thursday between 11:40 a.m. and 12 p.m. where members can direct questions to any member of the Scottish Government.
1831	8923	At 2.30pm, a 40-minute long themed "Question Time" takes place, where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day, such as health and justice or education and transport.
1831	8924	Between 12 p.m. and 12:30 p.m. on Thursdays, when Parliament is sitting, First Minister's Question Time takes place.
1831	8925	This gives members an opportunity to question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction.
1831	8926	Opposition leaders ask a general question of the First Minister and then supplementary questions.
1831	8927	Such a practice enables a "lead-in" to the questioner, who then uses their supplementary question to ask the First Minister any issue.
1831	8928	The four general questions available to opposition leaders are:
1832	8929	Of the 129 MSPs, 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as "Constituency MSPs".
1832	8930	Voters choose one member to represent the constituency, and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP.
1832	8931	The 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the UK Parliament constituencies in Scotland, prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of Scottish MPs, with the exception of Orkney and Shetland which each return their own constituency MSP.
1832	8932	Currently, the average Scottish Parliament constituency comprises 55,000 electors.
1832	8933	Given the geographical distribution of population in Scotland, this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the Central Lowlands, where the bulk of Scotland's population live, and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country, which have a low population density.
1832	8934	The island archipelagos of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles comprise a much smaller number of electors, due to their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.
1832	8935	If a Constituency MSP resigns from Parliament, this triggers a by-election in his or her constituency, where a replacement MSP is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system.
1833	8936	The total number of seats in the Parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method.
1833	8937	For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats).
1833	8938	The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat.
1833	8939	This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated.
1834	8940	As in the House of Commons, a number of qualifications apply to being an MSP.
1834	8941	Such qualifications were introduced under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the British Nationality Act 1981.
1834	8942	Specifically, members must be over the age of 18 and must be a citizen of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, a citizen of a British overseas territory, or a European Union citizen resident in the UK.
1834	8943	Members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs, and similarly, civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified.
1834	8944	An individual may not sit in the Scottish Parliament if he or she is judged to be insane under the terms of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.
1835	8945	The election produced a majority SNP government, making this the first time in the Scottish Parliament where a party has commanded a parliamentary majority.
1835	8946	The SNP took 16 seats from Labour, with many of their key figures not returned to parliament, although Labour leader Iain Gray retained East Lothian by 151 votes.
1835	8947	The SNP took a further eight seats from the Liberal Democrats and one seat from the Conservatives.
1835	8948	The SNP overall majority meant that there was sufficient support in the Scottish Parliament to hold a referendum on Scottish independence.
1836	8949	For the Conservatives, the main disappointment was the loss of Edinburgh Pentlands, the seat of former party leader David McLetchie, to the SNP.
1836	8950	McLetchie was elected on the Lothian regional list and the Conservatives suffered a net loss of five seats, with leader Annabel Goldie claiming that their support had held firm.
1836	8951	Nevertheless, she too announced she would step down as leader of the party.
1836	8952	Cameron congratulated the SNP on their victory but vowed to campaign for the Union in the independence referendum.
1837	8953	A procedural consequence of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament is that Scottish MPs sitting in the UK House of Commons are able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to England, Wales and Northern Ireland – whilst English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Westminster MPs are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the Scottish Parliament.
1837	8954	This phenomenon is known as the West Lothian question and has led to criticism.
1837	8955	Following the Conservative victory in the 2015 UK election, standing orders of the House of Commons were changed to give MPs representing English constituencies a new "veto" over laws only affecting England.
1838	8956	Islamism, also known as Political Islam (Arabic: إسلام سياسي‎ islām siyāsī), is an Islamic revival movement often characterized by moral conservatism, literalism, and the attempt "to implement Islamic values in all spheres of life."
1838	8957	Islamism favors the reordering of government and society in accordance with the Shari'a.
1838	8958	The different Islamist movements have been described as "oscillating between two poles": at one end is a strategy of Islamization of society through state power seized by revolution or invasion; at the other "reformist" pole Islamists work to Islamize society gradually "from the bottom up".
1838	8959	The movements have "arguably altered the Middle East more than any trend since the modern states gained independence", redefining "politics and even borders" according to one journalist (Robin Wright).
1839	8960	Moderate and reformist Islamists who accept and work within the democratic process include parties like the Tunisian Ennahda Movement.
1839	8961	Jamaat-e-Islami of Pakistan is basically a socio-political and democratic Vanguard party but has also gained political influence through military coup d'état in past.
1839	8962	The Islamist groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine participate in democratic and political process as well as armed attacks, seeking to abolish the state of Israel.
1839	8963	Radical Islamist organizations like al-Qaeda and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and groups such as the Taliban, entirely reject democracy, often declaring as kuffar those Muslims who support it (see takfirism), as well as calling for violent/offensive jihad or urging and conducting attacks on a religious basis.
1840	8964	Another major division within Islamism is between what Graham E. Fuller has described as the fundamentalist "guardians of the tradition" (Salafis, such as those in the Wahhabi movement) and the "vanguard of change and Islamic reform" centered around the Muslim Brotherhood.
1840	8965	Olivier Roy argues that "Sunni pan-Islamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century" when the Muslim Brotherhood movement and its focus on Islamisation of pan-Arabism was eclipsed by the Salafi movement with its emphasis on "sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions," and rejection of Shia Islam.
1840	8966	Following the Arab Spring, Roy has described Islamism as "increasingly interdependent" with democracy in much of the Arab Muslim world, such that "neither can now survive without the other."
1840	8967	While Islamist political culture itself may not be democratic, Islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy.
1840	8968	At the same time, their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic that excludes mainstream Islamist groups.
1841	8969	Islamism is a controversial concept not just because it posits a political role for Islam but also because its supporters believe their views merely reflect Islam, while the contrary idea that Islam is, or can be, apolitical is an error.
1841	8970	Scholars and observers who do not believe that Islam is merely a political ideology include Fred Halliday, John Esposito and Muslim intellectuals like Javed Ahmad Ghamidi.
1841	8971	Hayri Abaza argues the failure to distinguish between Islam and Islamism leads many in the West to support illiberal Islamic regimes, to the detriment of progressive moderates who seek to separate religion from politics.
1842	8972	Islamists have asked the question, "If Islam is a way of life, how can we say that those who want to live by its principles in legal, social, political, economic, and political spheres of life are not Muslims, but Islamists and believe in Islamism, not [just] Islam?"
1842	8973	Similarly, a writer for the International Crisis Group maintains that "the conception of 'political Islam'" is a creation of Americans to explain the Iranian Islamic Revolution and apolitical Islam was a historical fluke of the "short-lived era of the heyday of secular Arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970", and it is quietist/non-political Islam, not Islamism, that requires explanation.
1843	8974	During the 1970s and sometimes later, Western and pro-Western governments often supported sometimes fledgling Islamists and Islamist groups that later came to be seen as dangerous enemies.
1843	8975	Islamists were considered by Western governments bulwarks against—what were thought to be at the time—more dangerous leftist/communist/nationalist insurgents/opposition, which Islamists were correctly seen as opposing.
1843	8976	The US spent billions of dollars to aid the mujahideen Muslim Afghanistan enemies of the Soviet Union, and non-Afghan veterans of the war returned home with their prestige, "experience, ideology, and weapons", and had considerable impact.
1844	8977	Egyptian President Anwar Sadat – whose policies included opening Egypt to Western investment (infitah); transferring Egypt's allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States; and making peace with Israel – released Islamists from prison and welcomed home exiles in tacit exchange for political support in his struggle against leftists.
1844	8978	His "encouraging of the emergence of the Islamist movement" was said to have been "imitated by many other Muslim leaders in the years that followed."
1844	8979	This "gentlemen's agreement" between Sadat and Islamists broke down in 1975 but not before Islamists came to completely dominate university student unions.
1844	8980	Sadat was later assassinated and a formidable insurgency was formed in Egypt in the 1990s.
1844	8981	The French government has also been reported to have promoted Islamist preachers "in the hope of channeling Muslim energies into zones of piety and charity."
1845	8982	The interpretation of Islam promoted by this funding was the strict, conservative Saudi-based Wahhabism or Salafism.
1845	8983	In its harshest form it preached that Muslims should not only "always oppose" infidels "in every way," but "hate them for their religion ... for Allah's sake," that democracy "is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century," that Shia and other non-Wahhabi Muslims were infidels, etc.
1845	8984	While this effort has by no means converted all, or even most Muslims to the Wahhabist interpretation of Islam, it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations, and has set the Saudi-interpretation of Islam as the "gold standard" of religion in minds of some or many Muslims.
1846	8985	Islamist movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood, "are well known for providing shelters, educational assistance, free or low cost medical clinics, housing assistance to students from out of town, student advisory groups, facilitation of inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies to avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands, legal assistance, sports facilities, and women's groups."
1846	8986	All this compares very favourably against incompetent, inefficient, or neglectful governments whose commitment to social justice is limited to rhetoric.
1847	8987	While studying law and philosophy in England and Germany, Iqbal became a member of the London branch of the All India Muslim League.
1847	8988	He came back to Lahore in 1908.
1847	8989	While dividing his time between law practice and philosophical poetry, Iqbal had remained active in the Muslim League.
1847	8990	He did not support Indian involvement in World War I and remained in close touch with Muslim political leaders such as Muhammad Ali Johar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
1847	8991	He was a critic of the mainstream Indian nationalist and secularist Indian National Congress.
1847	8992	Iqbal's seven English lectures were published by Oxford University press in 1934 in a book titled The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam.
1847	8993	These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion as well as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age.
1848	8994	Iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nationalism weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that India's Hindu-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence.
1848	8995	In his travels to Egypt, Afghanistan, Palestine and Syria, he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences.
1848	8996	Sir Muhammad Iqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in Allahabad as well as for the session in Lahore in 1932.
1848	8997	In his Allahabad Address on 29 December 1930, Iqbal outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in northwestern India.
1848	8998	This address later inspired the Pakistan movement.
1849	8999	Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi was an important early twentieth-century figure in the Islamic revival in India, and then after independence from Britain, in Pakistan.
1849	9000	Trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journalism, and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about Islam and Islamic law.
1849	9001	Maududi founded the Jamaat-e-Islami party in 1941 and remained its leader until 1972.
1849	9002	However, Maududi had much more impact through his writing than through his political organising.
1849	9003	His extremely influential books (translated into many languages) placed Islam in a modern context, and influenced not only conservative ulema but liberal modernizer Islamists such as al-Faruqi, whose "Islamization of Knowledge" carried forward some of Maududi's key principles.
1850	9004	Maududi also believed that Muslim society could not be Islamic without Sharia, and Islam required the establishment of an Islamic state.
1850	9005	This state should be a "theo-democracy," based on the principles of: tawhid (unity of God), risala (prophethood) and khilafa (caliphate).
1850	9006	Although Maududi talked about Islamic revolution, by "revolution" he meant not the violence or populist policies of the Iranian Revolution, but the gradual changing the hearts and minds of individuals from the top of society downward through an educational process or da'wah.
1851	9007	Roughly contemporaneous with Maududi was the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood in Ismailiyah, Egypt in 1928 by Hassan al Banna.
1851	9008	His was arguably the first, largest and most influential modern Islamic political/religious organization.
1851	9009	Under the motto "the Qur'an is our constitution," it sought Islamic revival through preaching and also by providing basic community services including schools, mosques, and workshops.
1851	9010	Like Maududi, Al Banna believed in the necessity of government rule based on Shariah law implemented gradually and by persuasion, and of eliminating all imperialist influence in the Muslim world.
1852	9011	Some elements of the Brotherhood, though perhaps against orders, did engage in violence against the government, and its founder Al-Banna was assassinated in 1949 in retaliation for the assassination of Egypt's premier Mahmud Fami Naqrashi three months earlier.
1852	9012	The Brotherhood has suffered periodic repression in Egypt and has been banned several times, in 1948 and several years later following confrontations with Egyptian president Gamal Abdul Nasser, who jailed thousands of members for several years.
1853	9013	Despite periodic repression, the Brotherhood has become one of the most influential movements in the Islamic world, particularly in the Arab world.
1853	9014	For many years it was described as "semi-legal" and was the only opposition group in Egypt able to field candidates during elections.
1853	9015	In the Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011–2012, the political parties identified as "Islamist" (the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, Salafi Al-Nour Party and liberal Islamist Al-Wasat Party) won 75% of the total seats.
1853	9016	Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist democrat of Muslim Brotherhood, was the first democratically elected president of Egypt.
1853	9017	He was deposed during the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état.
1854	9018	The quick and decisive defeat of the Arab troops during the Six-Day War by Israeli troops constituted a pivotal event in the Arab Muslim world.
1854	9019	The defeat along with economic stagnation in the defeated countries, was blamed on the secular Arab nationalism of the ruling regimes.
1854	9020	A steep and steady decline in the popularity and credibility of secular, socialist and nationalist politics ensued.
1854	9021	Ba'athism, Arab socialism, and Arab nationalism suffered, and different democratic and anti-democratic Islamist movements inspired by Maududi and Sayyid Qutb gained ground.
1855	9022	The views of Ali Shariati, ideologue of the Iranian Revolution, had resemblance with Mohammad Iqbal, ideological father of the State of Pakistan, but Khomeini's beliefs is perceived to be placed somewhere between beliefs of Sunni Islamic thinkers like Mawdudi and Qutb.
1855	9023	He believed that complete imitation of the Prophet Mohammad and his successors such as Ali for restoration of Sharia law was essential to Islam, that many secular, Westernizing Muslims were actually agents of the West serving Western interests, and that the acts such as "plundering" of Muslim lands was part of a long-term conspiracy against Islam by the Western governments.
1856	9024	The Islamic Republic has also maintained its hold on power in Iran in spite of US economic sanctions, and has created or assisted like-minded Shia terrorist groups in Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Jordan (SCIRI) and Lebanon (Hezbollah) (two Muslim countries that also have large Shiite populations).
1856	9025	During the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, the Iranian government enjoyed something of a resurgence in popularity amongst the predominantly Sunni "Arab street," due to its support for Hezbollah and to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's vehement opposition to the United States and his call that Israel shall vanish.
1857	9026	In 1979, the Soviet Union deployed its 40th Army into Afghanistan, attempting to suppress an Islamic rebellion against an allied Marxist regime in the Afghan Civil War.
1857	9027	The conflict, pitting indigenous impoverished Muslims (mujahideen) against an anti-religious superpower, galvanized thousands of Muslims around the world to send aid and sometimes to go themselves to fight for their faith.
1857	9028	Leading this pan-Islamic effort was Palestinian sheikh Abdullah Yusuf Azzam.
1857	9029	While the military effectiveness of these "Afghan Arabs" was marginal, an estimated 16,000 to 35,000 Muslim volunteers came from around the world came to fight in Afghanistan.
1858	9030	Another factor in the early 1990s that worked to radicalize the Islamist movement was the Gulf War, which brought several hundred thousand US and allied non-Muslim military personnel to Saudi Arabian soil to put an end to Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait.
1858	9031	Prior to 1990 Saudi Arabia played an important role in restraining the many Islamist groups that received its aid.
1858	9032	But when Saddam, secularist and Ba'athist dictator of neighboring Iraq, attacked Saudi Arabia (his enemy in the war), western troops came to protect the Saudi monarchy.
1858	9033	Islamists accused the Saudi regime of being a puppet of the west.
1859	9034	These attacks resonated with conservative Muslims and the problem did not go away with Saddam's defeat either, since American troops remained stationed in the kingdom, and a de facto cooperation with the Palestinian-Israeli peace process developed.
1859	9035	Saudi Arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic Islamists who attacked it (bin Laden being a prime example), and increasing aid to Islamic groups (Islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent Islamist groups) that did not, but its pre-war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced.
1859	9036	One result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in Egypt, a bloody civil war in Algeria and Osama bin Laden's terror attacks climaxing in the 9/11 attack.
1860	9037	While Qutb's ideas became increasingly radical during his imprisonment prior to his execution in 1966, the leadership of the Brotherhood, led by Hasan al-Hudaybi, remained moderate and interested in political negotiation and activism.
1860	9038	Fringe or splinter movements inspired by the final writings of Qutb in the mid-1960s (particularly the manifesto Milestones, a.k.a.
1860	9039	Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq) did, however, develop and they pursued a more radical direction.
1860	9040	By the 1970s, the Brotherhood had renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals.
1861	9041	The path of violence and military struggle was then taken up by the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization responsible for the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981.
1861	9042	Unlike earlier anti-colonial movements the extremist group directed its attacks against what it believed were "apostate" leaders of Muslim states, leaders who held secular leanings or who had introduced or promoted Western/foreign ideas and practices into Islamic societies.
1861	9043	Its views were outlined in a pamphlet written by Muhammad Abd al-Salaam Farag, in which he states:
1862	9044	Another of the Egyptian groups which employed violence in their struggle for Islamic order was al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (Islamic Group).
1862	9045	Victims of their campaign against the Egyptian state in the 1990s included the head of the counter-terrorism police (Major General Raouf Khayrat), a parliamentary speaker (Rifaat al-Mahgoub), dozens of European tourists and Egyptian bystanders, and over 100 Egyptian police.
1862	9046	Ultimately the campaign to overthrow the government was unsuccessful, and the major jihadi group, Jamaa Islamiya (or al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya), renounced violence in 2003.
1862	9047	Other lesser known groups include the Islamic Liberation Party, Salvation from Hell and Takfir wal-Hijra, and these groups have variously been involved in activities such as attempted assassinations of political figures, arson of video shops and attempted takeovers of government buildings.
1863	9048	For some decades prior to the First Palestine Intifada in 1987, the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine took a "quiescent" stance towards Israel, focusing on preaching, education and social services, and benefiting from Israel's "indulgence" to build up a network of mosques and charitable organizations.
1863	9049	As the First Intifada gathered momentum and Palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising, the Brotherhood announced the formation of HAMAS ("zeal"), devoted to Jihad against Israel.
1863	9050	Rather than being more moderate than the PLO, the 1988 Hamas charter took a more uncompromising stand, calling for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in Palestine.
1863	9051	It was soon competing with and then overtaking the PLO for control of the intifada.
1863	9052	The Brotherhood's base of devout middle class found common cause with the impoverished youth of the intifada in their cultural conservatism and antipathy for activities of the secular middle class such as drinking alcohol and going about without hijab.
1864	9053	Hamas has continued to be a major player in Palestine.
1864	9054	From 2000 to 2007 it killed 542 people in 140 suicide bombing or "martyrdom operations".
1864	9055	In the January 2006 legislative election—its first foray into the political process—it won the majority of the seats, and in 2007 it drove the PLO out of Gaza.
1864	9056	Hamas has been praised by Muslims for driving Israel out of the Gaza Strip, but criticized for failure to achieve its demands in the 2008-9 and 2014 Gaza Wars despite heavy destruction and significant loss of life.
1865	9057	For many years, Sudan had an Islamist regime under the leadership of Hassan al-Turabi.
1865	9058	His National Islamic Front first gained influence when strongman General Gaafar al-Nimeiry invited members to serve in his government in 1979.
1865	9059	Turabi built a powerful economic base with money from foreign Islamist banking systems, especially those linked with Saudi Arabia.
1865	9060	He also recruited and built a cadre of influential loyalists by placing sympathetic students in the university and military academy while serving as minister of education.
1866	9061	After al-Nimeiry was overthrown in 1985 the party did poorly in national elections, but in 1989 it was able to overthrow the elected post-al-Nimeiry government with the help of the military.
1866	9062	Turabi was noted for proclaiming his support for the democratic process and a liberal government before coming to power, but strict application of sharia law, torture and mass imprisonment of the opposition, and an intensification of the long-running war in southern Sudan, once in power.
1866	9063	The NIF regime also harbored Osama bin Laden for a time (before 9/11), and worked to unify Islamist opposition to the American attack on Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War.
1867	9064	An Islamist movement influenced by Salafism and the jihad in Afghanistan, as well as the Muslim Brotherhood, was the FIS or Front Islamique de Salut (the Islamic Salvation Front) in Algeria.
1867	9065	Founded as a broad Islamist coalition in 1989 it was led by Abbassi Madani, and a charismatic Islamist young preacher, Ali Belhadj.
1867	9066	Taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liberalization and secularization by the ruling leftist-nationalist FLN government, it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following Sharia law, economic liberalization and development program, education in Arabic rather than French, and gender segregation, with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young Algerian men.
1867	9067	The FIS won sweeping victories in local elections and it was going to win national elections in 1991 when voting was canceled by a military coup d'état.
1868	9068	In Afghanistan, the mujahideen's victory against the Soviet Union in the 1980s did not lead to justice and prosperity, due to a vicious and destructive civil war between political and tribal warlords, making Afghanistan one of the poorest countries on earth.
1868	9069	In 1992, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan ruled by communist forces collapsed, and democratic Islamist elements of mujahdeen founded the Islamic State of Afghanistan.
1868	9070	In 1996, a more conservative and anti-democratic Islamist movement known as the Taliban rose to power, defeated most of the warlords and took over roughly 80% of Afghanistan.
1869	9071	The Taliban were spawned by the thousands of madrasahs the Deobandi movement established for impoverished Afghan refugees and supported by governmental and religious groups in neighboring Pakistan.
1869	9072	The Taliban differed from other Islamist movements to the point where they might be more properly described as Islamic fundamentalist or neofundamentalist, interested in spreading "an idealized and systematized version of conservative tribal village customs" under the label of Sharia to an entire country.
1869	9073	Their ideology was also described as being influenced by Wahhabism, and the extremist jihadism of their guest Osama bin Laden.
1870	9074	In July 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq overthrew Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's regime in Pakistan.
1870	9075	Ali Bhutto, a leftist in democratic competition with Islamists, had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months, shortly before he was overthrown.
1870	9076	Zia-ul-Haq was much more committed to Islamism, and "Islamization" or implementation of Islamic law, became a cornerstone of his eleven-year military dictatorship and Islamism became his "official state ideology".
1870	9077	Zia ul Haq was an admirer of Mawdudi and Mawdudi's party Jamaat-e-Islami became the "regime's ideological and political arm".
1870	9078	In Pakistan this Islamization from above was "probably" more complete "than under any other regime except those in Iran and Sudan," but Zia-ul-Haq was also criticized by many Islamists for imposing "symbols" rather than substance, and using Islamization to legitimize his means of seizing power.
1870	9079	Unlike neighboring Iran, Zia-ul-Haq's policies were intended to "avoid revolutionary excess", and not to strain relations with his American and Persian Gulf state allies.
1870	9080	Zia-ul-Haq was killed in 1988 but Islamization remains an important element in Pakistani society.
1871	9081	"The Islamic State", formerly known as the "Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant" and before that as the "Islamic State of Iraq", (and called the acronym Daesh by its many detractors), is a Wahhabi/Salafi jihadist extremist militant group which is led by and mainly composed of Sunni Arabs from Iraq and Syria.
1871	9082	In 2014, the group proclaimed itself a caliphate, with religious, political and military authority over all Muslims worldwide.
1871	9083	As of March 2015[update], it had control over territory occupied by ten million people in Iraq and Syria, and has nominal control over small areas of Libya, Nigeria and Afghanistan.
1871	9084	(While a self-described state, it lacks international recognition.)
1871	9085	The group also operates or has affiliates in other parts of the world, including North Africa and South Asia.
1872	9086	Originating as the Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad in 1999, it pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda in 2004, participated in the Iraqi insurgency that followed the March 2003 invasion of Iraq by Western forces, joined the fight in the Syrian Civil War beginning in March 2011, and was expelled from al-Qaeda in early 2014, (which complained of its failure to consult and "notorious intransigence").
1872	9087	The group gained prominence after it drove Iraqi government forces out of key cities in western Iraq in a 2014 offensive.
1872	9088	The group is adept at social media, posting Internet videos of beheadings of soldiers, civilians, journalists and aid workers, and is known for its destruction of cultural heritage sites.
1872	9089	The United Nations has held ISIL responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes, and Amnesty International has reported ethnic cleansing by the group on a "historic scale".
1872	9090	The group has been designated a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, the European Union and member states, the United States, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria and other countries.
1873	9091	In its focus on the Caliphate, the party takes a different view of Muslim history than some other Islamists such as Muhammad Qutb.
1873	9092	HT sees Islam's pivotal turning point as occurring not with the death of Ali, or one of the other four rightly guided Caliphs in the 7th century, but with the abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924.
1873	9093	This is believed to have ended the true Islamic system, something for which it blames "the disbelieving (Kafir) colonial powers" working through Turkish modernist Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.
1874	9094	HT does not engage in armed jihad or work for a democratic system, but works to take power through "ideological struggle" to change Muslim public opinion, and in particular through elites who will "facilitate" a "change of the government," i.e., launch a "bloodless" coup.
1874	9095	It allegedly attempted and failed such coups in 1968 and 1969 in Jordan, and in 1974 in Egypt, and is now banned in both countries.
1874	9096	But many HT members have gone on to join terrorist groups and many jihadi terrorists have cited HT as their key influence.
1875	9097	Greater London has over 900,000 Muslims, (most of South Asian origins and concentrated in the East London boroughs of Newham, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest), and among them are some with a strong Islamist outlook.
1875	9098	Their presence, combined with a perceived British policy of allowing them free rein, heightened by exposés such as the 2007 Channel 4 documentary programme Undercover Mosque, has given rise to the term Londonistan.
1875	9099	Following the 9/11 attacks, however, Abu Hamza al-Masri, the imam of the Finsbury Park Mosque, was arrested and charged with incitement to terrorism which has caused many Islamists to leave the UK to avoid internment.
1876	9100	The U.S. government has engaged in efforts to counter Islamism, or violent Islamism, since 2001.
1876	9101	These efforts were centred in the U.S. around public diplomacy programmes conducted by the State Department.
1876	9102	There have been calls to create an independent agency in the U.S. with a specific mission of undermining Islamism and jihadism.
1876	9103	Christian Whiton, an official in the George W. Bush administration, called for a new agency focused on the nonviolent practice of "political warfare" aimed at undermining the ideology.
1876	9104	U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates called for establishing something similar to the defunct U.S. Information Agency, which was charged with undermining the communist ideology during the Cold War.
1877	9105	Imperialism is a type of advocacy of empire.
1877	9106	Its name originated from the Latin word "imperium", which means to rule over large territories.
1877	9107	Imperialism is "a policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means".
1877	9108	Imperialism has greatly shaped the contemporary world.
1877	9109	It has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas.
1877	9110	The term imperialism has been applied to Western (and Japanese) political and economic dominance especially in Asia and Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries.
1877	9111	Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars.
1877	9112	Some writers, such as Edward Said, use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organised with an imperial center and a periphery.
1878	9113	Imperialism is defined as "A policy of extending a country’s power and influence through diplomacy or military force."
1878	9114	Imperialism is particularly focused on the control that one group, often a state power, has on another group of people.
1878	9115	This is often through various forms of "othering" (see other) based on racial, religious, or cultural stereotypes.
1878	9116	There are "formal" or "informal" imperialisms.
1878	9117	"Formal imperialism" is defined as "physical control or full-fledged colonial rule".
1878	9118	"Informal imperialism" is less direct; however, it is still a powerful form of dominance.
1879	9119	The definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers, or simply, general-purpose aggressiveness.
1879	9120	used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another.
1879	9121	To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of "formal" and "informal" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or "full-fledged colonial rule" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance.
1879	9122	Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally.
1879	9123	This is because, with informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid, ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully.
1880	9124	"The word ‘empire’ comes from the Latin word imperium; for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be ‘sovereignty’, or simply ‘rule’".
1880	9125	The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded.
1880	9126	Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes.
1880	9127	A distinction about empires is "that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea".
1880	9128	Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products.
1880	9129	European empires in Asia and Africa "have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires".
1880	9130	European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory.
1880	9131	The two main regions are the core and the periphery.
1880	9132	The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit.
1880	9133	These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world.
1880	9134	The Russian leader Lenin suggested that "imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism".
1880	9135	This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era.
1880	9136	Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.
1881	9137	The term "imperialism" is often conflated with "colonialism", however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition.
1881	9138	Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people.
1881	9139	Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions.
1881	9140	Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power.
1881	9141	Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; "imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.'
1881	9142	Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.
1881	9143	:116 Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as it lacks a political focus.
1882	9144	Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two.
1882	9145	Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally.
1882	9146	Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism.
1882	9147	Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled.
1882	9148	Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war.
1882	9149	The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance.
1882	9150	Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region.
1882	9151	Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.
1883	9152	A controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds.
1883	9153	A. Hobson identifies this justification on general grounds as: "It is desirable that the earth should be peopled, governed, and developed, as far as possible, by the races which can do this work best, i.e.
1883	9154	by the races of highest 'social efficiency'".
1883	9155	Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons.
1883	9156	Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed.
1883	9157	Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism.
1883	9158	The purportedly scientific nature of "Social Darwinism" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism.
1883	9159	The rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose, for example throughout Latin America "whiteness" is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento (whitening) are common.
1884	9160	The Royal Geographical Society of London and other geographical societies in Europe had great influence and were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries.
1884	9161	These societies also served as a space for travellers to share these stories.Political geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel of Germany and Halford Mackinder of Britain also supported imperialism.
1884	9162	Ratzel believed expansion was necessary for a state’s survival while Mackinder supported Britain’s imperial expansion; these two arguments dominated the discipline for decades.
1885	9163	Geographical theories such as environmental determinism also suggested that tropical environments created uncivilized people in need of European guidance.
1885	9164	For instance, American geographer Ellen Churchill Semple argued that even though human beings originated in the tropics they were only able to become fully human in the temperate zone.
1885	9165	Tropicality can be paralleled with Edward Said’s Orientalism as the west’s construction of the east as the “other”.
1885	9166	According to Siad, orientalism allowed Europe to establish itself as the superior and the norm, which justified its dominance over the essentialized Orient.
1886	9167	The principles of imperialism are often generalizable to the policies and practices of the British Empire "during the last generation, and proceeds rather by diagnosis than by historical description".
1886	9168	British imperialism often used the concept of Terra nullius (Latin expression which stems from Roman law meaning 'empty land').
1886	9169	The country of Australia serves as a case study in relation to British settlement and colonial rule of the continent in the eighteenth century, as it was premised on terra nullius, and its settlers considered it unused by its sparse Aboriginal inhabitants.
1887	9170	Orientalism, as theorized by Edward Said, refers to how the West developed an imaginative geography of the East.
1887	9171	This imaginative geography relies on an essentializing discourse that represents neither the diversity nor the social reality of the East.
1887	9172	Rather, by essentializing the East, this discourse uses the idea of place-based identities to create difference and distance between "we" the West and "them" the East, or "here" in the West and "there" in the East.
1887	9173	This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient that positioned the East as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive West.
1887	9174	Defining the East as a negative vision of itself, as its inferior, not only increased the West’s sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so that it could be dominated and controlled.
1887	9175	The discourse of Orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism, as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other territories.
1888	9176	To better illustrate this idea, Bassett focuses his analysis of the role of nineteenth-century maps during the "scramble for Africa".
1888	9177	He states that maps "contributed to empire by promoting, assisting, and legitimizing the extension of French and British power into West Africa".
1888	9178	During his analysis of nineteenth-century cartographic techniques, he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory.
1888	9179	This provided incentives for imperial and colonial powers to obtain "information to fill in blank spaces on contemporary maps".
1889	9180	Imperialism has played an important role in the histories of Japan, Korea, the Assyrian Empire, the Chinese Empire, the Roman Empire, Greece, the Byzantine Empire, the Persian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Ancient Egypt, the British Empire, India, and many other empires.
1889	9181	Imperialism was a basic component to the conquests of Genghis Khan during the Mongol Empire, and of other war-lords.
1889	9182	Historically recognized Muslim empires number in the dozens.
1889	9183	Sub-Saharan Africa has also featured dozens of empires that predate the European colonial era, for example the Ethiopian Empire, Oyo Empire, Asante Union, Luba Empire, Lunda Empire, and Mutapa Empire.
1889	9184	The Americas during the pre-Columbian era also had large empires such as the Aztec Empire and the Incan Empire.
1890	9185	Cultural imperialism is when a country's influence is felt in social and cultural circles, i.e.
1890	9186	its soft power, such that it changes the moral, cultural and societal worldview of another.
1890	9187	This is more than just "foreign" music, television or film becoming popular with young people, but that popular culture changing their own expectations of life and their desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted.
1890	9188	For example, depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera Dallas during the Cold War changed the expectations of Romanians; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled South Korean drama series in North Korea.
1890	9189	The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc.
1890	9190	Nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants.
1891	9191	The Age of Imperialism, a time period beginning around 1700, saw (generally European) industrializing nations engaging in the process of colonizing, influencing, and annexing other parts of the world in order to gain political power.
1891	9192	[citation needed] Although imperialist practices have existed for thousands of years, the term "Age of Imperialism" generally refers to the activities of European powers from the early 18th century through to the middle of the 20th century, for example, the "The Great Game" in Persian lands, the "Scramble for Africa" and the "Open Door Policy" in China.
1892	9193	During the 20th century, historians John Gallagher (1919–1980) and Ronald Robinson (1920–1999) constructed a framework for understanding European imperialism.
1892	9194	They claim that European imperialism was influential, and Europeans rejected the notion that "imperialism" required formal, legal control by one government over another country.
1892	9195	"In their view, historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red.
1892	9196	The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire.
1892	9197	Key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary.
1892	9198	'"[attribution needed] Because of the resources made available by imperialism, the world's economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected in the decades before World War I, making the many imperial powers rich and prosperous.
1893	9199	Europe's expansion into territorial imperialism was largely focused on economic growth by collecting resources from colonies, in combination with assuming political control by military and political means.
1893	9200	The colonization of India in the mid-18th century offers an example of this focus: there, the "British exploited the political weakness of the Mughal state, and, while military activity was important at various times, the economic and administrative incorporation of local elites was also of crucial significance" for the establishment of control over the subcontinent's resources, markets, and manpower.
1893	9201	Although a substantial number of colonies had been designed to provide economic profit and to ship resources to home ports in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Fieldhouse suggests that in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in places such as Africa and Asia, this idea is not necessarily valid:
1894	9202	Along with advancements in communication, Europe also continued to advance in military technology.
1894	9203	European chemists made deadly explosives that could be used in combat, and with innovations in machinery they were able to manufacture improved firearms.
1894	9204	By the 1880s, the machine gun had become an effective battlefield weapon.
1894	9205	This technology gave European armies an advantage over their opponents, as armies in less-developed countries were still fighting with arrows, swords, and leather shields (e.g.
1894	9206	the Zulus in Southern Africa during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879).
1895	9207	In anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience.
1895	9208	The term "Imperialism" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.
1895	9209	It was shortly appropriated by supporters of "imperialism" such as Joseph Chamberlain.
1895	9210	For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed.
1895	9211	Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term.
1895	9212	Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism.
1895	9213	In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion.
1895	9214	This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians.
1895	9215	Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of "imperialism".
1895	9216	Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades.
1895	9217	As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal.
1895	9218	Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power.
1896	9219	The correlation between capitalism, aristocracy, and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists.
1896	9220	Much of the debate was pioneered by such theorists as J.
1896	9221	A. Hobson (1858–1940), Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950), Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929), and Norman Angell (1872–1967).
1896	9222	While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the interwar years.
1896	9223	Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and it's impact on Europe, as well as contributed to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s.
1896	9224	Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation.
1896	9225	Hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption, create wealth, and encourage a peaceful, tolerant, multipolar world order.
1897	9226	The concept environmental determinism served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples.
1897	9227	It was believed that a certain person's behaviours were determined by the environment in which they lived and thus validated their domination.
1897	9228	For example, people living in tropical environments were seen as "less civilized" therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission.
1897	9229	Across the three waves of European colonialism (first in the Americas, second in Asia and lastly in Africa), environmental determinism was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy.
1897	9230	This takes two forms, orientalism and tropicality.
1898	9231	According to geographic scholars under colonizing empires, the world could be split into climatic zones.
1898	9232	These scholars believed that Northern Europe and the Mid-Atlantic temperate climate produced a hard-working, moral, and upstanding human being.
1898	9233	Alternatively, tropical climates yielded lazy attitudes, sexual promiscuity, exotic culture, and moral degeneracy.
1898	9234	The people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from the European empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure; they were seen as incapable of such a feat.
1898	9235	Similarly, orientalism is a view of a people based on their geographical location.
1899	9236	Britain's imperialist ambitions can be seen as early as the sixteenth century.
1899	9237	In 1599 the British East India Company was established and was chartered by Queen Elizabeth in the following year.
1899	9238	With the establishment of trading posts in India, the British were able to maintain strength relative to others empires such as the Portuguese who already had set up trading posts in India.
1899	9239	In 1767 political activity caused exploitation of the East India Company causing the plundering of the local economy, almost bringing the company into bankruptcy.
1900	9240	France took control of Algeria in 1830 but began in earnest to rebuild its worldwide empire after 1850, concentrating chiefly in North and West Africa, as well as South-East Asia, with other conquests in Central and East Africa, as well as the South Pacific.
1900	9241	Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany started to build her own colonial empire.
1900	9242	As it developed, the new empire took on roles of trade with France, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items, as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading French civilization and language as well as Catholicism.
1900	9243	It also provided crucial manpower in both World Wars.
1901	9244	It became a moral justification to lift the world up to French standards by bringing Christianity and French culture.
1901	9245	In 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism, Jules Ferry declared France had a civilising mission: "The higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior".
1901	9246	Full citizenship rights – ‘’assimilation’’ – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon.
1901	9247	Contrasting from Britain, France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of Algeria, where French settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority.
1902	9248	In World War II, Charles de Gaulle and the Free French used the overseas colonies as bases from which they fought to liberate France.
1902	9249	However after 1945 anti-colonial movements began to challenge the Empire.
1902	9250	France fought and lost a bitter war in Vietnam in the 1950s.
1902	9251	Whereas they won the war in Algeria, the French leader at the time, Charles de Gaulle, decided to grant Algeria independence anyway in 1962.
1902	9252	Its settlers and many local supporters relocated to France.
1902	9253	Nearly all of France's colonies gained independence by 1960, but France retained great financial and diplomatic influence.
1902	9254	It has repeatedly sent troops to assist its former colonies in Africa in suppressing insurrections and coups d’état.
1903	9255	From their original homelands in Scandinavia and northern Europe, Germanic tribes expanded throughout northern and western Europe in the middle period of classical antiquity; southern Europe in late antiquity, conquering Celtic and other peoples; and by 800 CE, forming the Holy Roman Empire, the first German Empire.
1903	9256	However, there was no real systemic continuity from the Western Roman Empire to its German successor which was famously described as "not holy, not Roman, and not an empire", as a great number of small states and principalities existed in the loosely autonomous confederation.
1903	9257	Although by 1000 CE, the Germanic conquest of central, western, and southern Europe (west of and including Italy) was complete, excluding only Muslim Iberia.
1903	9258	There was, however, little cultural integration or national identity, and "Germany" remained largely a conceptual term referring to an amorphous area of central Europe.
1904	9259	Not a maritime power, and not a nation-state, as it would eventually become, Germany’s participation in Western imperialism was negligible until the late 19th century.
1904	9260	The participation of Austria was primarily as a result of Habsburg control of the First Empire, the Spanish throne, and other royal houses.
1904	9261	[further explanation needed] After the defeat of Napoleon, who caused the dissolution of that Holy Roman Empire, Prussia and the German states continued to stand aloof from imperialism, preferring to manipulate the European system through the Concert of Europe.
1904	9262	After Prussia unified the other states into the second German Empire after the Franco-German War, its long-time Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck (1862–90), long opposed colonial acquisitions, arguing that the burden of obtaining, maintaining, and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefits.
1904	9263	He felt that colonies did not pay for themselves, that the German bureaucratic system would not work well in the tropics and the diplomatic disputes over colonies would distract Germany from its central interest, Europe itself.
1905	9264	However, in 1883–84 Germany began to build a colonial empire in Africa and the South Pacific, before losing interest in imperialism.
1905	9265	Historians have debated exactly why Germany made this sudden and short-lived move.
1905	9266	[verification needed] Bismarck was aware that public opinion had started to demand colonies for reasons of German prestige.
1905	9267	He was influenced by Hamburg merchants and traders, his neighbors at Friedrichsruh.
1905	9268	The establishment of the German colonial empire proceeded smoothly, starting with German New Guinea in 1884.
1906	9269	During the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Japan absorbed Taiwan.
1906	9270	As a result of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan took part of Sakhalin Island from Russia.
1906	9271	During World War I, Japan took German-leased territories in China’s Shandong Province, as well as the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands.
1906	9272	In 1918, Japan occupied parts of far eastern Russia and parts of eastern Siberia as a participant in the Siberian Intervention.
1906	9273	In 1931 Japan conquered Manchuria from China.
1906	9274	During the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Japan's military invaded central China and by the end of the Pacific War, Japan had conquered much of the Far East, including Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Indonesia, part of New Guinea and some islands of the Pacific Ocean.
1906	9275	Japan also invaded Thailand, pressuring the country into a Thai/Japanese alliance.
1906	9276	Its colonial ambitions were ended by the victory of the United States in the Second World War and the following treaties which remanded those territories to American administration or their original owners.
1907	9277	Bolshevik leaders had effectively reestablished a polity with roughly the same extent as that empire by 1921, however with an internationalist ideology: Lenin in particular asserted the right to limited self-determination for national minorities within the new territory.
1907	9278	Beginning in 1923, the policy of "Indigenization" [korenizatsiia] was intended to support non-Russians develop their national cultures within a socialist framework.
1907	9279	Never formally revoked, it stopped being implemented after 1932.
1907	9280	After World War II, the Soviet Union installed socialist regimes modeled on those it had installed in 1919–20 in the old Tsarist Empire in areas its forces occupied in Eastern Europe.
1907	9281	The Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China supported post–World War II communist movements in foreign nations and colonies to advance their own interests, but were not always successful.
1908	9282	Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution.
1908	9283	Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism.
1908	9284	However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements.
1908	9285	The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War.
1908	9286	With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the "thaw", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda.
1908	9287	In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders.
1908	9288	Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires.
1908	9289	Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states.
1908	9290	It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control.
1908	9291	Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade.
1908	9292	Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government.
1908	9293	Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.
1909	9294	The First British Empire was based on mercantilism, and involved colonies and holdings primarily in North America, the Caribbean, and India.
1909	9295	Its growth was reversed by the loss of the American colonies in 1776.
1909	9296	Britain made compensating gains in India, Australia, and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of trade and finance in Latin America after the independence of Spanish and Portuguese colonies about 1820.
1909	9297	By the 1840s, Britain had adopted a highly successful policy of free trade that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world.
1909	9298	After losing its first Empire to the Americans, Britain then turned its attention towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific.
1909	9299	Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815, Britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe.
1909	9300	Increasing degrees of internal autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies in the 20th century.
1910	9301	A resurgence came in the late 19th century, with the Scramble for Africa and major additions in Asia and the Middle East.
1910	9302	The British spirit of imperialism was expressed by Joseph Chamberlain and Lord Rosebury, and implemented in Africa by Cecil Rhodes.
1910	9303	The pseudo-sciences of Social Darwinism and theories of race formed an ideological underpinning during this time.
1910	9304	Other influential spokesmen included Lord Cromer, Lord Curzon, General Kitchner, Lord Milner, and the writer Rudyard Kipling.
1910	9305	The British Empire was the largest Empire that the world has ever seen both in terms of landmass and population.
1910	9306	Its power, both military and economic, remained unmatched.
1911	9307	The early United States expressed its opposition to Imperialism, at least in a form distinct from its own Manifest Destiny, through policies such as the Monroe Doctrine.
1911	9308	However, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century, policies such as Theodore Roosevelt’s interventionism in Central America and Woodrow Wilson’s mission to "make the world safe for democracy" changed all this.
1911	9309	They were often backed by military force, but were more often affected from behind the scenes.
1911	9310	This is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires.
1911	9311	In 1898, Americans who opposed imperialism created the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose the US annexation of the Philippines and Cuba.
1911	9312	One year later, a war erupted in the Philippines causing business, labor and government leaders in the US to condemn America's occupation in the Philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many Filipinos.
1911	9313	American foreign policy was denounced as a "racket" by Smedley Butler, an American general.
1911	9314	He said, "Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints.
1911	9315	The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts.
1912	9316	One key figure in the plans for what would come to be known as American Empire, was a geographer named Isiah Bowman.
1912	9317	Bowman was the director of the American Geographical Society in 1914.
1912	9318	Three years later in 1917, he was appointed to then President Woodrow Wilson's inquiry in 1917.
1912	9319	The inquiry was the idea of President Wilson and the American delegation from the Paris Peace Conference.
1912	9320	The point of this inquiry was to build a premise that would allow for U.S authorship of a 'new world' which was to be characterized by geographical order.
1912	9321	As a result of his role in the inquiry, Isiah Bowman would come to be known as Wilson's geographer.
1913	9322	Some have described the internal strife between various people groups as a form of imperialism or colonialism.
1913	9323	This internal form is distinct from informal U.S. imperialism in the form of political and financial hegemony.
1913	9324	This internal form of imperialism is also distinct from the United States' formation of "colonies" abroad.
1913	9325	Through the treatment of its indigenous peoples during westward expansion, the United States took on the form of an imperial power prior to any attempts at external imperialism.
1913	9326	This internal form of empire has been referred to as "internal colonialism".
1913	9327	Participation in the African slave trade and the subsequent treatment of its 12 to 15 million Africans is viewed by some to be a more modern extension of America's "internal colonialism".
1913	9328	However, this internal colonialism faced resistance, as external colonialism did, but the anti-colonial presence was far less prominent due to the nearly complete dominance that the United States was able to assert over both indigenous peoples and African-Americans.
1913	9329	In his lecture on April 16, 2003, Edward Said made a bold statement on modern imperialism in the United States, whom he described as using aggressive means of attack towards the contemporary Orient, "due to their backward living, lack of democracy and the violation of women’s rights.
1913	9330	The western world forgets during this process of converting the other that enlightenment and democracy are concepts that not all will agree upon".
1914	9331	The Ottoman Empire was an imperial state that lasted from 1299 to 1923.
1914	9332	During the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire was a powerful multinational, multilingual empire controlling much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, the Caucasus, North Africa, and the Horn of Africa.
1914	9333	At the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states.
1914	9334	Some of these were later absorbed into the empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries.
1915	9335	With Istanbul as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean basin, the Ottoman Empire was at the center of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries.
1915	9336	Following a long period of military setbacks against European powers, the Ottoman Empire gradually declined into the late nineteenth century.
1915	9337	The empire allied with Germany in the early 20th century, with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, but it dissolved in the aftermath of World War I, leading to the emergence of the new state of Turkey in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland, as well as the creation of modern Balkan and Middle Eastern states, thus ending Turkish colonial ambitions.
1916	9338	The United Methodist Church (UMC) is a mainline Protestant Methodist denomination.
1916	9339	In the 19th century its main predecessor was a leader in Evangelicalism.
1916	9340	Founded in 1968 by the union of the Methodist Church (USA) and the Evangelical United Brethren Church, the UMC traces its roots back to the revival movement of John and Charles Wesley in England as well as the Great Awakening in the United States.
1916	9341	As such, the church's theological orientation is decidedly Wesleyan.
1916	9342	It embraces both liturgical and evangelical elements.
1917	9343	The United Methodist Church is the largest denomination within the wider Methodist movement, which has approximately 80 million adherents across the world.
1917	9344	In the United States, the UMC ranks as the largest mainline Protestant denomination, the largest Protestant church after the Southern Baptist Convention, and the third largest Christian denomination.
1917	9345	As of 2014, worldwide membership was about 12 million: 7.2 million in the United States, and 4.4 million in Africa, Asia and Europe.
1917	9346	It is a member of the World Council of Churches, the World Methodist Council, and other religious associations.
1917	9347	In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 3.6% of the U.S population, or 9 million adult adherents, self-identify with the United Methodist Church revealing a much larger number of adherents than registered membership.
1918	9348	The movement which would become The United Methodist Church began in the mid-18th century within the Church of England.
1918	9349	A small group of students, including John Wesley, Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, met on the Oxford University campus.
1918	9350	They focused on Bible study, methodical study of scripture and living a holy life.
1918	9351	Other students mocked them, saying they were the "Holy Club" and "the Methodists", being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions and disciplined lifestyle.
1918	9352	Eventually, the so-called Methodists started individual societies or classes for members of the Church of England who wanted to live a more religious life.
1919	9353	In 1735, John and Charles Wesley went to America to teach the gospel to the American Indians in the colony of Georgia.
1919	9354	In less than two years, the "Holy Club" disbanded.
1919	9355	John Wesley returned to England and met with a group of clergy he respected.
1919	9356	He said "they appeared to be of one heart, as well as of one judgment, resolved to be Bible-Christians at all events; and, wherever they were, to preach with all their might plain, old, Bible Christianity".
1919	9357	The ministers retained their membership in the Church of England.
1919	9358	Though not always emphasized or appreciated in the Anglican churches of their day, their teaching emphasized salvation by God's grace, acquired through faith in Christ.
1919	9359	Three teachings they saw as the foundation of Christian faith were:
1920	9360	Though John Wesley originally wanted the Methodists to stay within the Church of England, the American Revolution decisively separated the Methodists in the American colonies from the life and sacraments of the Anglican Church.
1920	9361	In 1784, after unsuccessful attempts to have the Church of England send a bishop to start a new church in the colonies, Wesley decisively appointed fellow priest Thomas Coke as superintendent (bishop) to organize a separate Methodist Society.
1920	9362	Together with Coke, Wesley sent a revision of the Anglican Prayerbook and the Articles of Religion which were received and adopted by the Baltimore Christmas Conference of 1784, officially establishing the Methodist Episcopal Church.
1920	9363	The conference was held at the Lovely Lane Methodist Church, considered the Mother Church of American Methodism.
1921	9364	St. George's United Methodist Church, located at the corner of 4th and New Streets, in the Old City neighborhood of Philadelphia, is the oldest Methodist church in continuous use in the United States, beginning in 1769.
1921	9365	The congregation was founded in 1767, meeting initially in a sail loft on Dock Street, and in 1769 it purchased the shell of a building which had been erected in 1763 by a German Reformed congregation.
1921	9366	At this time, Methodists had not yet broken away from the Anglican Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church was not founded until 1784.
1922	9367	Richard Allen and Absalom Jones became the first African Americans ordained by the Methodist Church.
1922	9368	They were licensed by St. George's Church in 1784.
1922	9369	Three years later, protesting racial segregation in the worship services, Allen led most of the black members out of St. George's; eventually they founded the Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church and the African Methodist Episcopal denomination.
1922	9370	Absalom Jones became an Episcopal priest.
1922	9371	In 1836, the church's basement was excavated to make room for a Sunday School.
1922	9372	In the 1920s a court case saved the church from being demolished to make way for the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.
1922	9373	The case resulted in the bridge being relocated.
1922	9374	Historic St Georges welcomes visitors and is home to archives and a museum on Methodism.
1923	9375	In the more than 220 years since 1784, Methodism in the United States, like many other Protestant denominations, has seen a number of divisions and mergers.
1923	9376	In 1830, the Methodist Protestant Church split from the Methodist Episcopal Church over the issue of laity having a voice and vote in the administration of the church, insisting that clergy should not be the only ones to have any determination in how the church was to be operated.
1923	9377	In 1844, the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church split into two conferences because of tensions over slavery and the power of bishops in the denomination.
1924	9378	On April 23, 1968, the United Methodist Church was created when the Evangelical United Brethren Church (represented by Bishop Reuben H. Mueller) and The Methodist Church (represented by Bishop Lloyd Christ Wicke) joined hands at the constituting General Conference in Dallas, Texas.
1924	9379	With the words, "Lord of the Church, we are united in Thee, in Thy Church and now in The United Methodist Church" the new denomination was given birth by the two churches that had distinguished histories and influential ministries in various parts of the world.
1925	9380	The United Methodist Church understands itself to be part of the holy catholic (or universal) church and it recognizes the historic ecumenical creeds, the Apostle's Creed and the Nicene Creed; which are used frequently in services of worship.
1925	9381	The Book of Discipline also recognizes the importance of the Chalcedonian Creed of the Council of Chalcedon.
1925	9382	It upholds the concept of the "visible and invisible Church," meaning that all who are truly believers in every age belong to the holy Church invisible, while the United Methodist Church is a branch of the Church visible, to which all believers must be connected as it is the only institution wherein the Word of God is preached and the Sacraments are administered.
1926	9383	Some argue that The United Methodist Church can lay a claim on apostolic succession, as understood in the traditional sense.
1926	9384	As a result of the American Revolution, John Wesley was compelled in 1784 to break with standard practice and ordain two of his lay preachers as presbyters, Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat.
1926	9385	Dr. Thomas Coke, already an Anglican priest, assisted Wesley in this action.
1926	9386	Coke was then "set apart" as a superintendent (bishop) by Wesley and dispatched with Vasey and Whatcoat to America to take charge of Methodist activities there.
1926	9387	In defense of his action to ordain, Wesley himself cited an ancient opinion from the Church of Alexandria, which held that bishops and presbyters constituted one order and therefore, bishops are to be elected from and by the presbyterate.
1926	9388	He knew that for two centuries the succession of bishops in the Church of Alexandria was preserved through ordination by presbyters alone and was considered valid by the ancient church.
1926	9389	Methodists today who would argue for apostolic succession would do so on these grounds.
1927	9390	While many United Methodist congregations operate in the evangelical tradition, others reflect the mainline Protestant traditions.
1927	9391	Although United Methodist practices and interpretation of beliefs have evolved over time, these practices and beliefs can be traced to the writings of the church's founders, especially John Wesley and Charles Wesley (Anglicans), but also Philip William Otterbein and Martin Boehm (United Brethren), and Jacob Albright (Evangelical Association).
1927	9392	With the formation of The United Methodist Church in 1968, theologian Albert C. Outler led the team which systematized denominational doctrine.
1927	9393	Outler's work proved pivotal in the work of union, and he is largely considered the first United Methodist theologian.
1928	9394	Prevenient grace, or the grace that "goes before" us, is given to all people.
1928	9395	It is that power which enables us to love and motivates us to seek a relationship with God through Jesus Christ.
1928	9396	This grace is the present work of God to turn us from our sin-corrupted human will to the loving will of the Father.
1928	9397	In this work, God desires that we might sense both our sinfulness before God and God's offer of salvation.
1928	9398	Prevenient grace allows those tainted by sin to nevertheless make a truly free choice to accept or reject God's salvation in Christ.
1929	9399	Justifying Grace or Accepting Grace is that grace, offered by God to all people, that we receive by faith and trust in Christ, through which God pardons the believer of sin.
1929	9400	It is in justifying grace we are received by God, in spite of our sin.
1929	9401	In this reception, we are forgiven through the atoning work of Jesus Christ on the cross.
1929	9402	The justifying grace cancels our guilt and empowers us to resist the power of sin and to fully love God and neighbor.
1929	9403	Today, justifying grace is also known as conversion, "accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior," or being "born again".
1929	9404	John Wesley originally called this experience the New Birth.
1929	9405	This experience can occur in different ways; it can be one transforming moment, such as an altar call experience, or it may involve a series of decisions across a period of time.
1930	9406	Sanctifying Grace is that grace of God which sustains the believers in the journey toward Christian Perfection: a genuine love of God with heart, soul, mind, and strength, and a genuine love of our neighbors as ourselves.
1930	9407	Sanctifying grace enables us to respond to God by leading a Spirit-filled and Christ-like life aimed toward love.
1930	9408	Wesley never claimed this state of perfection for himself but instead insisted the attainment of perfection was possible for all Christians.
1930	9409	Here the English Reformer parted company with both Luther and Calvin, who denied that a man would ever reach a state in this life in which he could not fall into sin.
1930	9410	Such a man can lose all inclination to evil and can gain perfection in this life.
1931	9411	Wesleyan theology stands at a unique cross-roads between evangelical and sacramental, between liturgical and charismatic, and between Anglo-Catholic and Reformed theology and practice.
1931	9412	It has been characterized as Arminian theology with an emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit to bring holiness into the life of the participating believer.
1931	9413	The United Methodist Church believes in prima scriptura, seeing the Holy Bible as the primary authority in the Church and using sacred tradition, reason, and experience to interpret it, with the aid of the Holy Spirit (see Wesleyan Quadrilateral).
1931	9414	Therefore, according to The Book of Discipline, United Methodist theology is at once "catholic, evangelical, and reformed."
1931	9415	Today, the UMC is generally considered one of the more moderate and tolerant denominations with respect to race, gender, and ideology, though the denomination itself actually includes a very wide spectrum of attitudes.
1931	9416	Comparatively, the UMC stands to the right of liberal and progressive Protestant groups such as the United Church of Christ and the Episcopal Church on certain issues (especially regarding sexuality), but to the left of historically conservative evangelical traditions such as the Southern Baptists and Pentecostalism, in regard to theological matters such as social justice and Biblical interpretation.
1931	9417	However, it should be noted that the UMC is made up of a broad diversity of thought, and so there are many clergy and laity within the UMC that hold differing viewpoints on such theological matters.
1932	9418	The United Methodist Church upholds the sanctity of human life both of the child and the mother.
1932	9419	As a result, the church is "reluctant to affirm abortion as an acceptable practice," and condemns the use of late-term or partial birth abortion except as a medical necessity.
1932	9420	The denomination as a whole is committed to "assist[ing] the ministry of crisis pregnancy centers and pregnancy resource centers that compassionately help women find feasible alternatives to abortion."
1932	9421	Still, the denomination is pro-choice and also "was a founding member of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice...[and] 2008 General Conference [went] on record in support of the work of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice".
1933	9422	The church also holds that they "are equally bound to respect the sacredness of the life and well-being of the mother, for whom devastating damage may result from an unacceptable pregnancy.
1933	9423	In continuity with past Christian teaching, we recognize tragic conflicts of life with life that may justify abortion, and in such cases we support the legal option of abortion under proper medical procedures."
1933	9424	As such, two official bodies of the United Methodist Church are part of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice's governing coalition, The General Board of Church and Society, and the United Methodist Women.
1933	9425	The church cautions that "Governmental laws and regulations do not provide all the guidance required by the informed Christian conscience."
1933	9426	The Church emphasizes the need to be in supportive ministry with all women, regardless of their choice.
1934	9427	Members of the United Methodist Church who identify with the pro-life position have organized into the Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality (TUMAS) to further their position within the denomination.
1934	9428	There was an attempt to withdraw the United Methodist Church membership in the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice at their General Conference, held in May 2012, with a petition that passed through the legislative subcommittee and committee votes, but was not given a floor vote.
1934	9429	Paul T. Stallsworth, president of the Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality said he "had every reason to believe" that pro-life delegates would have won a floor vote.
1935	9430	Historically, the Methodist Church has supported the temperance movement.
1935	9431	John Wesley warned against the dangers of drinking in his famous sermon, "The Use of Money," and in his letter to an alcoholic.
1935	9432	At one time, Methodist ministers had to take a pledge not to drink and encouraged their congregations to do the same.
1935	9433	Today the United Methodist Church states that it "affirms our long-standing support of abstinence from alcohol as a faithful witness to God's liberating and redeeming love for persons."
1935	9434	In fact, the United Methodist Church uses unfermented grape juice in the sacrament of Holy Communion, thus "expressing pastoral concern for recovering alcoholics, enabling the participation of children and youth, and supporting the church's witness of abstinence."
1935	9435	Moreover, in 2011 and 2012, The United Methodist Church's General Board of Church and Society called on all United Methodists to abstain from alcohol for Lent.
1936	9436	The United Methodist Church, along with other Methodist churches, condemns capital punishment, saying that it cannot accept retribution or social vengeance as a reason for taking human life.
1936	9437	The Church also holds that the death penalty falls unfairly and unequally upon marginalized persons including the poor, the uneducated, ethnic and religious minorities, and persons with mental and emotional illnesses.
1936	9438	The United Methodist Church also believes that Jesus explicitly repudiated the lex talionis in Matthew 5:38-39 and abolished the death penalty in John 8:7.
1936	9439	The General Conference of the United Methodist Church calls for its bishops to uphold opposition to capital punishment and for governments to enact an immediate moratorium on carrying out the death penalty sentence.
1937	9440	In addition, the United Methodist Church prohibits the celebration of same-sex unions.
1937	9441	Jimmy Creech was defrocked after a highly publicized church trial in 1999 on account of his participation in same-sex union ceremonies.
1937	9442	It forbids any United Methodist board, agency, committee, commission, or council to give United Methodist funds to any gay organization or group, or otherwise use such funds to promote the acceptance of homosexuality.
1937	9443	Other ministers have been defrocked for officiating at same-sex weddings and several trials of others are scheduled.
1937	9444	Still, some congregations have sought other ways to recognize same-sex couples.
1937	9445	For example, one congregation hosted a proposal for a same-sex couple announcing their engagement.
1937	9446	Moreover, some churches, especially in 2016 after same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide, have provided blessings for same-sex marriages.
1937	9447	In April of 2016, a United Methodist bishop made a bold statement by performing a same-sex marriage in church as a clear sign of his advocacy for change.
1938	9448	Nevertheless, The United Methodist Church "implore[s] families and churches not to reject or condemn lesbian and gay members and friends" and commits itself to be in ministry with all persons, affirming that God's grace, love, and forgiveness is available to all.
1938	9449	Additionally, many organizations, conferences, and congregations have recently called for broader acceptance of the LGBT community within the UMC.
1938	9450	For example, the Connectional Table, a governing committee, has voted in favor of a proposal that calls for a localized option, which would permit ministers to officiate same-sex weddings, and it would allow conferences to ordain gay clergy.
1938	9451	Moreover, many conferences have taken a position by voting in favor of same-gender marriages with resolutions.
1939	9452	In 1987, a United Methodist church court in New Hampshire defrocked Methodist minister Rose Mary Denman for openly living with a same-sex partner.
1939	9453	In 2005, clergy credentials were removed from Irene Elizabeth Stroud after she was convicted in a church trial of violating church law by engaging in a lesbian relationship; this conviction was later upheld by the Judicial Council, the highest court in the denomination.
1939	9454	The Judicial Council also affirmed that a Virginia pastor had the right to deny local church membership to a man in an openly gay relationship.
1939	9455	This affirmation, however, was based upon a senior pastor's right to judge the readiness of a congregant to join as a full member of the church.
1939	9456	However, at the same time, the UMC Judicial Council, in 2008, ruled that conferences can determine their own policy related to transgender pastors, and therefore some regional conferences have voted to recognize ordained transgender pastors.
1939	9457	The Baltimore-Washington Conference of the UMC has approved the appointment of an openly partnered lesbian to the provisional diaconate.
1940	9458	The United Methodist Church opposes conscription as incompatible with the teaching of Scripture.
1940	9459	Therefore, the Church supports and extends its ministry to those persons who conscientiously oppose all war, or any particular war, and who therefore refuse to serve in the armed forces or to cooperate with systems of military conscription.
1940	9460	However, the United Methodist Church also supports and extends its ministry to those persons who conscientiously choose to serve in the armed forces or to accept alternative service.
1940	9461	The church also states that "as Christians they are aware that neither the way of military action, nor the way of inaction is always righteous before God."
1941	9462	The United Methodist Church maintains that war is incompatible with Christ's message and teachings.
1941	9463	Therefore, the Church rejects war as an instrument of national foreign policy, to be employed only as a last resort in the prevention of such evils as genocide, brutal suppression of human rights, and unprovoked international aggression.
1941	9464	It insists that the first moral duty of all nations is to resolve by peaceful means every dispute that arises between or among them; that human values must outweigh military claims as governments determine their priorities; that the militarization of society must be challenged and stopped; that the manufacture, sale, and deployment of armaments must be reduced and controlled; and that the production, possession, or use of nuclear weapons be condemned.
1941	9465	Consequently, the United Methodist Church endorses general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.
1942	9466	The United Methodist Church teaches that pornography is "about violence, degradation, exploitation, and coercion" and "deplore[s] all forms of commercialization, abuse, and exploitation of sex."
1942	9467	The Sexual Ethics Task Force of The United Methodist Church states that "Research shows it [pornography] is not an 'innocent activity.'
1942	9468	It is harmful and is generally addictive.
1942	9469	Persons who are addicted to pornography are physiologically altered, as is their perspective, relationships with parishioners and family, and their perceptions of girls and women."
1943	9470	The UMC supports federal funding for research on embryos created for IVF that remain after the procreative efforts have ceased, if the embryos were provided for research instead of being destroyed, were not obtained by sale, and those donating had given prior informed consent for the research purposes.
1943	9471	The UMC stands in "opposition to the creation of embryos for the sake of research" as "a human embryo, even at its earliest stages, commands our reverence."
1943	9472	It supports research on stem cells retrieved from umbilical cords and adult stem cells, stating that there are "few moral questions" raised by this issue.
1944	9473	The common pattern comes from John Wesley, who wrote that "there is no Liturgy in the world, either in ancient or modern language, which breathes more of a solid, scriptural, rational piety, than the Common Prayer of the Church of England."
1944	9474	When the Methodists in America were separated from the Church of England, John Wesley himself provided a revised version of The Book of Common Prayer called the Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America.
1944	9475	Wesley's Sunday Service has shaped the official liturgies of the Methodists ever since.
1945	9476	Like other historic Christian churches, The United Methodist Church has official liturgies for services of Holy Communion, baptism, weddings, funerals, ordination, anointing of the sick and daily office prayer services.
1945	9477	Some clergy offer healing services, while exorcism is an occasional practice by some clergy in The United Methodist Church in Africa.
1945	9478	These services involve the laying on of hands and anointing with oil.
1945	9479	Along with these, there are also special services for holy days such as All Saints Day, Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Vigil.
1945	9480	These services are contained in The United Methodist Hymnal and The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992).
1945	9481	Many of these liturgies are derived from the Anglican tradition's Book of Common Prayer.
1945	9482	In most cases, congregations also use other elements of liturgical worship, such as candles, vestments, paraments, banners, and liturgical art.
1946	9483	Methodist institutions may be named after a biblical figure (e.g., "St. James UMC").
1946	9484	Methodists also honor notable heroes and heroines of the Christian faith and look to these prominent saints as providing examples of holy living and commitment to Christ that are worthy of imitation (see 1 Corinthians 11:1).
1946	9485	Such exemplary saints include martyrs, confessors of the Faith, evangelists, or important biblical figures such as Saint Matthew, Lutheran theologian and martyr to the Nazis Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Salvation Army Founder William Booth, African missionary David Livingstone and Methodism's revered founder John Wesley are among many cited as Protestant saints.
1947	9486	The United Methodist Church is organized into conferences.
1947	9487	The highest level is called the General Conference and is the only organization which may speak officially for the church.
1947	9488	The General Conference meets every four years (quadrennium).
1947	9489	Legislative changes are recorded in The Book of Discipline which is revised after each General Conference.
1947	9490	Non-legislative resolutions are recorded in the Book of Resolutions, which is published after each General Conference, and expire after eight years unless passed again by a subsequent session of General Conference.
1947	9491	The last General Conference was held in Tampa, Florida, in 2012.
1947	9492	The event is currently rotated between the U.S. jurisdictions of the church.
1947	9493	The 2016 General Conference will be in Portland, Oregon.
1947	9494	Bishops, Councils, Committees, Boards, Elders, etc., are not permitted to speak on behalf of The United Methodist Church as this authority is reserved solely for the General Conference in accordance with the Book of Discipline.
1948	9495	Subordinate to the General Conference are the jurisdictional and central conferences which also meet every four years.
1948	9496	The United States is divided into five jurisdictions: Northeastern, Southeastern, North Central, South Central and Western.
1948	9497	Outside the United States the church is divided into seven central conferences: Africa, Congo, West Africa, Central & Southern Europe, Germany, Northern Europe and the Philippines.
1948	9498	The main purpose of the jurisdictions and central conferences is to elect and appoint bishops, the chief administrators of the church.
1948	9499	Bishops thus elected serve Episcopal Areas, which consist of one or more Annual Conferences.
1949	9500	Decisions in-between the four-year meetings are made by the Mission Council (usually consisting of church bishops).
1949	9501	One of the most high profile decisions in recent years by one of the councils was a decision by the Mission Council of the South Central Jurisdiction which in March 2007 approved a 99-year lease of 36 acres (150,000 m2) at Southern Methodist University for the George W. Bush Presidential Library.
1949	9502	The decision generated controversy in light of Bush's support of the Iraq War which the church bishops have criticized.
1949	9503	A debate over whether the decision should or could be submitted for approval by the Southern Jurisdictional Conference at its July 2008 meeting in Dallas, Texas, remains unresolved.
1950	9504	The Judicial Council is the highest court in the denomination.
1950	9505	It consists of nine members, both laity and clergy, elected by the General Conference for an eight-year term.
1950	9506	The ratio of laity to clergy alternates every eight years.
1950	9507	The Judicial Council interprets the Book of Discipline between sessions of General Conference, and during General Conference, the Judicial Council rules on the constitutionality of laws passed by General Conference.
1950	9508	The Council also determines whether actions of local churches, annual conferences, church agencies, and bishops are in accordance with church law.
1950	9509	The Council reviews all decisions of law made by bishops The Judicial Council cannot create any legislation; it can only interpret existing legislation.
1950	9510	The Council meets twice a year at various locations throughout the world.
1950	9511	The Judicial Council also hears appeals from those who have been accused of chargeable offenses that can result in defrocking or revocation of membership.
1951	9512	The Annual Conference, roughly the equivalent of a diocese in the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church or a synod in some Lutheran denominations such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, is the basic unit of organization within the UMC.
1951	9513	The term Annual Conference is often used to refer to the geographical area it covers as well as the frequency of meeting.
1951	9514	Clergy are members of their Annual Conference rather than of any local congregation, and are appointed to a local church or other charge annually by the conference's resident Bishop at the meeting of the Annual Conference.
1951	9515	In many ways, the United Methodist Church operates in a connectional organization of the Annual Conferences, and actions taken by one conference are not binding upon another.
1952	9516	The Book of Discipline is the guidebook for local churches and pastors and describes in considerable detail the organizational structure of local United Methodist churches.
1952	9517	All UM churches must have a board of trustees with at least three members and no more than nine members and it is recommended that no gender should hold more than a 2/3 majority.
1952	9518	All churches must also have a nominations committee, a finance committee and a church council or administrative council.
1952	9519	Other committees are suggested but not required such as a missions committee, or evangelism or worship committee.
1952	9520	Term limits are set for some committees but not for all.
1952	9521	The church conference is an annual meeting of all the officers of the church and any interested members.
1952	9522	This committee has the exclusive power to set pastors' salaries (compensation packages for tax purposes) and to elect officers to the committees.
1953	9523	Throughout its history, the United Methodist Church has placed great emphasis on the importance of education.
1953	9524	As such, the United Methodist Church established and is affiliated with around one hundred colleges and universities in the United States, including Syracuse University, Boston University, Emory University, Duke University, Drew University, University of Denver, University of Evansville, and Southern Methodist University.
1953	9525	Most are members of the International Association of Methodist-related Schools, Colleges, and Universities.
1953	9526	The church operates three hundred sixty schools and institutions overseas.
1954	9527	The first Methodist clergy were ordained by John Wesley, a priest of the Church of England, because of the crisis caused by the American Revolution which isolated the Methodists in the States from the Church of England and its sacraments.
1954	9528	Today, the clergy includes men and women who are ordained by bishops as elders and deacons and are appointed to various ministries.
1954	9529	Elders in the United Methodist Church itenerate and are subject to the authority and appointment of their bishops.
1954	9530	They generally serve as pastors in local congregations.
1954	9531	Deacons are in service ministry and may serve as musicians, liturgists, educators, business administrators, and a number of other areas.
1954	9532	Elders and deacons are required to obtain a master's degree (generally an M.Div.
1954	9533	), or another equivalent degree, before commissioning and then ultimately ordination.
1954	9534	Elders in full connection are each a member of their Annual Conference Order of Elders.
1954	9535	Likewise each deacon in full connection is a member of their Annual Conference Order of Deacons.
1955	9536	All clergy appointments are made and fixed annually by the resident bishop on the advice of the Annual Conference Cabinet, which is composed of the Area Provost/Dean (if one is appointed) and the several District Superintendents of the Districts of the Annual Conference.
1955	9537	Until the bishop has read the appointments at the session of the Annual Conference, no appointments are officially fixed.
1955	9538	Many Annual Conferences try to avoid making appointment changes between sessions of Annual Conference.
1955	9539	While an appointment is made one year at a time, it is most common for an appointment to be continued for multiple years.
1955	9540	Appointment tenures in extension ministries, such as military chaplaincy, campus ministry, missions, higher education and other ministries beyond the local church are often even longer.
1956	9541	Elders are called by God, affirmed by the church, and ordained by a bishop to a ministry of Word, Sacrament, Order and Service within the church.
1956	9542	They may be appointed to the local church, or to other valid extension ministries of the church.
1956	9543	Elders are given the authority to preach the Word of God, administer the sacraments of the church, to provide care and counseling, and to order the life of the church for ministry and mission.
1956	9544	Elders may also be assigned as District Superintendents, and they are eligible for election to the episcopacy.
1956	9545	Elders serve a term of 2–3 years as provisional Elders prior to their ordination.
1957	9546	Deacons are called by God, affirmed by the church, and ordained by a bishop to servant leadership within the church.They are ordained to ministries of word, service, compassion, and justice.
1957	9547	They may be appointed to ministry within the local church or to an extension ministry that supports the mission of the church.
1957	9548	Deacons give leadership, preach the Word, contribute in worship, conduct marriages, bury the dead, and aid the church in embodying its mission within the world.
1957	9549	Deacons assist elders in the sacraments of Holy Communion and Baptism, and may be granted sacramental authority if they are appointed as the pastor in a local church.
1957	9550	Deacons serve a term of 2–3 years as provisional deacons prior to their ordination.
1958	9551	At the 1996 General Conference the ordination order of transitional deacon was abolished.
1958	9552	This created new orders known as "provisional elder" or "provisional deacon" for those who seek to be ordained in the respective orders.
1958	9553	The provisional elder/deacon is a seminary graduate who serves a two-three-year term in a full-time appointment after being commissioned.
1958	9554	During this two or three-year period, the provisional elder is granted sacramental ministry in their local appointment.
1958	9555	For the first time in its history non-ordained pastors became a normal expectation, rather than an extraordinary provision for ministry.
1959	9556	Local Pastors are called by God, affirmed by the church, and appointed by a bishop to a ministry of Word, Sacrament, Order and Service within the church.
1959	9557	The Local Pastor are given the authority to preach the Word of God, administer the sacraments of the church, to provide care and counseling, and to order the life of the church for ministry and mission, but are not ordained.
1959	9558	When elders are not available to be appointed to a local church, either through shortage of personnel or financial hardship of a pastoral charge, the bishop may appoint a "local pastor" to serve the pastoral appointment.
1959	9559	Local Pastors are often bi-vocational, living out their ministerial call in the local church and in their field of employment.
1959	9560	Full-time and part-time licensed local pastors under appointment are clergy and hold membership in the annual conference and not in the local church.
1959	9561	A Local Pastor's official title is 'Licensed Local Pastor' and is appointed as clergy to the local church where they preach, conduct divine worship and perform the regular duties of a pastor.
1959	9562	The licensed local pastor has the authority of a pastor only within the context and during the time of the appointment and shall not extend beyond it.
1959	9563	Local pastors are not required to have advanced degrees but are required to attend licensing school and attend and pass an approved five-year course of study at an approved United Methodist seminary or course of study school, successfully complete written and oral examinations, and appear before the District Committee on Ministry and the Conference Board of Ordained Ministry.
1959	9564	They may continue towards Associate Membership allowing them to retire as clergy.
1959	9565	They also may continue towards ordination if they complete their bachelor's degree, requirements of their particular Conference Board of Ordained Ministry, as well as an advanced course or study or prescribed seminary courses at an approved seminary.
1959	9566	Upon retirement, local pastors return to their charge conference as lay members.
1960	9567	The United Methodist Church (UMC) practices infant and adult baptism.
1960	9568	Baptized Members are those who have been baptized as an infant or child, but who have not subsequently professed their own faith.
1960	9569	These Baptized Members become Professing Members through confirmation and sometimes the profession of faith.
1960	9570	Individuals who were not previously baptized are baptized as part of their profession of faith and thus become Professing Members in this manner.
1960	9571	Individuals may also become a Professing Member through transfer from another Christian denomination.
1961	9572	Unlike confirmation and profession of faith, Baptism is a sacrament in the UMC.
1961	9573	The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church directs the local church to offer membership preparation or confirmation classes to all people, including adults.
1961	9574	The term confirmation is generally reserved for youth, while some variation on membership class is generally used for adults wishing to join the church.
1961	9575	The Book of Discipline normally allows any youth at least completing sixth grade to participate, although the pastor has discretionary authority to allow a younger person to participate.
1961	9576	In confirmation and membership preparation classes, students learn about Church and the Methodist-Christian theological tradition in order to profess their ultimate faith in Christ.
1962	9577	Another position in the United Methodist Church is that of the lay servant.
1962	9578	Although not considered clergy, lay speakers often preach during services of worship when an ordained elder, Local Pastor, Associate Member or deacon is unavailable.
1962	9579	There are two categories of lay servants: local church lay servant, who serve in and through their local churches, and certified lay servants, who serve in their own churches, in other churches, and through district or conference projects and programs.
1962	9580	To be recognized as local church lay servant, they must be recommended by their pastor and Church Council or Charge Conference, and complete the basic course for lay servant.
1962	9581	Each year they must reapply, reporting how they have served and continued to learn during that year.
1962	9582	To be recognized as certified lay servant, they must be recommended by their pastor and Church Council or Charge Conference, complete the basic course and one advanced lay servant course, and be interviewed by the District or Conference Committee on Lay Speaking.
1962	9583	They must report and reapply annually; and they must complete at least one advanced course every three years.
1963	9584	The United Methodist Church is one tradition within the Christian Church.
1963	9585	The United Methodist Church is active in ecumenical relations with other Christian groups and denominations.
1963	9586	It is a member of the National Council of Churches, the World Council of Churches, Churches Uniting in Christ, and Christian Churches Together.
1963	9587	In addition, it voted to seek observer status in the National Association of Evangelicals and in the World Evangelical Fellowship.
1963	9588	However, there are some in The United Methodist Church who feel that false ecumenism might result in the "blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity."
1964	9589	The United Methodist Church has since 1985 been exploring a possible merger with three historically African-American Methodist denominations: the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church.
1964	9590	A Commission on Pan Methodist Cooperation and Union formed in 2000 to carry out work on such a merger.
1964	9591	In May 2012, The United Methodist Church entered into full communion with the African Methodist Episcopal Church, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, African Union Methodist Protestant Church, Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, and Union American Methodist Episcopal Church, in which these Churches agreed to "recognize each other's churches, share sacraments, and affirm their clergy and ministries."
1965	9592	Like many other mainline Protestant denominations in the United States, the United Methodist Church has experienced significant membership losses in recent decades.
1965	9593	At the time of its formation, the UMC had about 11 million members in nearly 42,000 congregations.
1965	9594	In 1975, membership dropped below 10 million for the first time.
1965	9595	In 2005, there were about 8 million members in over 34,000 congregations.
1965	9596	Membership is concentrated primarily in the Midwest and in the South.
1965	9597	Texas has the largest number of members, with about 1 million.
1965	9598	The states with the highest membership rates are Oklahoma, Iowa, Mississippi, West Virginia, and North Carolina.
1966	9599	By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, total UMC membership was estimated at 11.4 million, with about 7.9 million in the U.S. and 3.5 million overseas.
1966	9600	Significantly, about 20% of the conference delegates were from Africa, with Filipinos and Europeans making up another 10%.
1966	9601	During the conference, the delegates voted to finalize the induction of the Methodist Church of the Ivory Coast and its 700,000 members into the denomination.
1966	9602	Given current trends in the UMC—with overseas churches growing, especially in Africa, and U.S. churches collectively losing about 1,000 members a week—it has been estimated that Africans will make up at least 30% of the delegates at the 2012 General Conference, and it is also possible that 40% of the delegates will be from outside the U.S. One Congolese bishop has estimated that typical Sunday attendance of the UMC is higher in his country than in the entire United States.
1967	9603	The UMC is also a member of the Wesleyan Holiness Consortium, which seeks to reconceive and promote Biblical holiness in today's Church.
1967	9604	It is also active in the World Methodist Council, an interdenominational group composed of various churches in the tradition of John Wesley to promote the Gospel throughout the world.
1967	9605	On July 18, 2006, delegates to the World Methodist Council voted unanimously to adopt the "Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification", which was approved in 1999 by the Vatican and the Lutheran World Federation.
1968	9606	The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War.
1968	9607	The war was fought between the colonies of British America and New France, with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, as well as Native American allies.
1968	9608	At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies.
1968	9609	The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians.
1968	9610	Long in conflict, the metropole nations declared war on each other in 1756, escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict.
1969	9611	The war was fought primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies, from Virginia in the South to Nova Scotia in the North.
1969	9612	It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, called the Forks of the Ohio, and the site of the French Fort Duquesne and present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
1969	9613	The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754, during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22-year-old George Washington ambushed a French patrol.
1970	9614	In 1755, six colonial governors in North America met with General Edward Braddock, the newly arrived British Army commander, and planned a four-way attack on the French.
1970	9615	None succeeded and the main effort by Braddock was a disaster; he was defeated in the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9, 1755 and died a few days later.
1970	9616	British operations in 1755, 1756 and 1757 in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York all failed, due to a combination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies.
1970	9617	In 1755, the British captured Fort Beauséjour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia; soon afterward they ordered the expulsion of the Acadians.
1970	9618	Orders for the deportation were given by William Shirley, Commander-in-Chief, North America, without direction from Great Britain.
1970	9619	The Acadians, both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty, were expelled.
1970	9620	Native Americans were likewise driven off their land to make way for settlers from New England.
1971	9621	After the disastrous 1757 British campaigns (resulting in a failed expedition against Louisbourg and the Siege of Fort William Henry, which was followed by Indian torture and massacres of British victims), the British government fell.
1971	9622	William Pitt came to power and significantly increased British military resources in the colonies at a time when France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces it had in New France.
1971	9623	France concentrated its forces against Prussia and its allies in the European theatre of the war.
1971	9624	Between 1758 and 1760, the British military launched a campaign to capture the Colony of Canada.
1971	9625	They succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and ultimately Quebec.
1971	9626	Though the British were later defeated at Sainte Foy in Quebec, the French ceded Canada in accordance with the 1763 treaty.
1972	9627	The outcome was one of the most significant developments in a century of Anglo-French conflict.
1972	9628	France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain.
1972	9629	It ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River (including New Orleans) to its ally Spain, in compensation for Spain's loss to Britain of Florida (Spain had ceded this to Britain in exchange for the return of Havana, Cuba).
1972	9630	France's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, confirming Britain's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America.
1973	9631	The conflict is known by multiple names.
1973	9632	In British America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War.
1973	9633	As there had already been a King George's War in the 1740s, British colonists named the second war in King George's reign after their opponents, and it became known as the French and Indian War.
1973	9634	This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States, but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict, and that this was part of the Seven Years' War, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain.
1973	9635	American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years' War.
1973	9636	Other, less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire.
1974	9637	In Europe, the North American theater of the Seven Years' War usually is not given a separate name.
1974	9638	The entire international conflict is known as the Seven Years' War.
1974	9639	"Seven Years" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763.
1974	9640	These dates do not correspond with the fighting on mainland North America, where the fighting between the two colonial powers was largely concluded in six years, from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760.
1975	9641	The French population numbered about 75,000 and was heavily concentrated along the St. Lawrence River valley, with some also in Acadia (present-day New Brunswick and parts of Nova Scotia, including Île Royale (present-day Cape Breton Island)).
1975	9642	Fewer lived in New Orleans, Biloxi, Mississippi, Mobile, Alabama and small settlements in the Illinois Country, hugging the east side of the Mississippi River and its tributaries.
1975	9643	French fur traders and trappers traveled throughout the St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds, did business with local tribes, and often married Indian women.
1975	9644	Traders married daughters of chiefs, creating high-ranking unions.
1976	9645	British settlers outnumbered the French 20 to 1 with a population of about 1.5 million ranged along the eastern coast of the continent, from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the north, to Georgia in the south.
1976	9646	Many of the older colonies had land claims that extended arbitrarily far to the west, as the extent of the continent was unknown at the time their provincial charters were granted.
1976	9647	While their population centers were along the coast, the settlements were growing into the interior.
1976	9648	Nova Scotia, which had been captured from France in 1713, still had a significant French-speaking population.
1976	9649	Britain also claimed Rupert's Land, where the Hudson's Bay Company traded for furs with local tribes.
1977	9650	In between the French and the British, large areas were dominated by native tribes.
1977	9651	To the north, the Mi'kmaq and the Abenaki were engaged in Father Le Loutre's War and still held sway in parts of Nova Scotia, Acadia, and the eastern portions of the province of Canada, as well as much of present-day Maine.
1977	9652	The Iroquois Confederation dominated much of present-day Upstate New York and the Ohio Country, although the latter also included Algonquian-speaking populations of Delaware and Shawnee, as well as Iroquoian-speaking Mingo.
1977	9653	These tribes were formally under Iroquois rule, and were limited by them in authority to make agreements.
1978	9654	Further south the Southeast interior was dominated by Siouan-speaking Catawba, Muskogee-speaking Creek and Choctaw, and the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee tribes.
1978	9655	When war broke out, the French used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region (an area not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British), including the Huron, Mississauga, Ojibwa, Winnebago, and Potawatomi.
1978	9656	The British were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee – until differences sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758.
1978	9657	In 1758 the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton, in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations.
1978	9658	Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms.
1978	9659	The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict.
1978	9660	It was not uncommon for small bands to participate on the "other side" of the conflict from formally negotiated agreements, as most tribes were decentralized and bands made their own decisions about warfare.
1979	9661	At the start of the war, no French regular army troops were stationed in North America, and few British troops.
1979	9662	New France was defended by about 3,000 troupes de la marine, companies of colonial regulars (some of whom had significant woodland combat experience).
1979	9663	The colonial government recruited militia support when needed.
1979	9664	Most British colonies mustered local militia companies, generally ill trained and available only for short periods, to deal with native threats, but did not have any standing forces.
1980	9665	Céloron's expedition force consisted of about 200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians.
1980	9666	The expedition covered about 3,000 miles (4,800 km) between June and November 1749.
1980	9667	It went up the St. Lawrence, continued along the northern shore of Lake Ontario, crossed the portage at Niagara, and followed the southern shore of Lake Erie.
1980	9668	At the Chautauqua Portage (near present-day Barcelona, New York), the expedition moved inland to the Allegheny River, which it followed to the site of present-day Pittsburgh.
1980	9669	There Céloron buried lead plates engraved with the French claim to the Ohio Country.
1980	9670	Whenever he encountered British merchants or fur-traders, Céloron informed them of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave.
1981	9671	When Céloron's expedition arrived at Logstown, the Native Americans in the area informed Céloron that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British regardless of the French.
1981	9672	Céloron continued south until his expedition reached the confluence of the Ohio and the Miami rivers, which lay just south of the village of Pickawillany, the home of the Miami chief known as "Old Briton".
1981	9673	Céloron threatened "Old Briton" with severe consequences if he continued to trade with the British.
1981	9674	Disappointed, Céloron returned to Montreal in November 1749.
1982	9675	In his extensively detailed report, Céloron wrote, "All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French, and are entirely devoted to the English.
1982	9676	I don't know in what way they could be brought back."
1982	9677	Even before his return to Montreal, reports on the situation in the Ohio Country were making their way to London and Paris, each side proposing that action be taken.
1982	9678	William Shirley, the expansionist governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, was particularly forceful, stating that British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present.
1982	9679	Conflicts between the colonies, accomplished through raiding parties that included Indian allies, had taken place for decades, leading to a brisk trade in European colonial captives from either side.
1983	9680	In 1749 the British government gave land to the Ohio Company of Virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the Ohio Country.
1983	9681	The grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory, and construct a fort for their protection.
1983	9682	But, as the territory was also claimed by Pennsylvania, both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims.
1983	9683	In 1750 Christopher Gist, acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company, explored the Ohio territory and opened negotiations with the Indian tribes at Logstown.
1983	9684	He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Indians, through their "Half-King" Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative, agreed to terms that included permission to build a "strong house" at the mouth of the Monongahela River (the site of present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania).
1983	9685	By the late 17th century, the Iroquois had pushed many tribes out of the Ohio Valley, and kept it as hunting ground by right of conquest.
1984	9686	The War of the Austrian Succession (whose North American theater is known as King George's War) formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.
1984	9687	The treaty was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe.
1984	9688	The issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies in North America were turned over to a commission to resolve, but it reached no decision.
1984	9689	Frontiers from between Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north, to the Ohio Country in the south, were claimed by both sides.
1984	9690	The disputes also extended into the Atlantic Ocean, where both powers wanted access to the rich fisheries of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.
1985	9691	On March 17, 1752, the Governor-General of New France, Marquis de la Jonquière, died and was temporarily replaced by Charles le Moyne de Longueuil.
1985	9692	His permanent replacement, the Marquis Duquesne, did not arrive in New France until 1752 to take over the post.
1985	9693	The continuing British activity in the Ohio territories prompted Longueuil to dispatch another expedition to the area under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade, an officer in the Troupes de la Marine.
1985	9694	Langlade was given 300 men, including French-Canadians and warriors of the Ottawa.
1985	9695	His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following Céloron's orders to cease trading with the British.
1985	9696	On June 21, the French war party attacked the trading centre at Pickawillany, capturing three traders and killing 14 people of the Miami nation, including Old Briton.
1985	9697	He was reportedly ritually cannibalized by some aboriginal members of the expedition.
1986	9698	In the spring of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000-man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians.
1986	9699	His orders were to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British.
1986	9700	Marin followed the route that Céloron had mapped out four years earlier, but where Céloron had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates, Marin constructed and garrisoned forts.
1986	9701	He first constructed Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania) on Lake Erie's south shore.
1986	9702	He had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek.
1986	9703	Marin constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania), designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek.
1986	9704	As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois.
1986	9705	Tanaghrisson, a chief of the Mingo, who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion.
1986	9706	He intensely disliked the French (whom he accused of killing and eating his father).
1986	9707	Traveling to Fort Le Boeuf, he threatened the French with military action, which Marin contemptuously dismissed.
1987	9708	The Iroquois sent runners to the manor of William Johnson in upstate New York.
1987	9709	The British Superintendent for Indian Affairs in the New York region and beyond, Johnson was known to the Iroquois as Warraghiggey, meaning "He who does great things."
1987	9710	He spoke their languages and had become a respected honorary member of the Iroquois Confederacy in the area.
1987	9711	In 1746, Johnson was made a colonel of the Iroquois.
1987	9712	Later he was commissioned as a colonel of the Western New York Militia.
1987	9713	They met at Albany, New York with Governor Clinton and officials from some of the other American colonies.
1987	9714	Mohawk Chief Hendrick, Speaker of their tribal council, insisted that the British abide by their obligations and block French expansion.
1987	9715	When Clinton did not respond to his satisfaction, Chief Hendrick said that the "Covenant Chain", a long-standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown, was broken.
1988	9716	Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia was an investor in the Ohio Company, which stood to lose money if the French held their claim.
1988	9717	To counter the French military presence in Ohio, in October 1753 Dinwiddie ordered the 21-year-old Major George Washington (whose brother was another Ohio Company investor) of the Virginia Regiment to warn the French to leave Virginia territory.
1988	9718	Washington left with a small party, picking up along the way Jacob Van Braam as an interpreter; Christopher Gist, a company surveyor working in the area; and a few Mingo led by Tanaghrisson.
1988	9719	On December 12, Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf.
1989	9720	Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, who succeeded Marin as commander of the French forces after the latter died on October 29, invited Washington to dine with him.
1989	9721	Over dinner, Washington presented Saint-Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country.
1989	9722	Saint-Pierre said, "As to the Summons you send me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it."
1989	9723	He told Washington that France's claim to the region was superior to that of the British, since René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier.
1990	9724	Even before Washington returned, Dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under William Trent to that point, where in the early months of 1754 they began construction of a small stockaded fort.
1990	9725	Governor Duquesne sent additional French forces under Claude-Pierre Pecaudy de Contrecœur to relieve Saint-Pierre during the same period, and Contrecœur led 500 men south from Fort Venango on April 5, 1754.
1990	9726	When these forces arrived at the fort on April 16, Contrecœur generously allowed Trent's small company to withdraw.
1990	9727	He purchased their construction tools to continue building what became Fort Duquesne.
1991	9728	After Washington had returned to Williamsburg, Dinwiddie ordered him to lead a larger force to assist Trent in his work.
1991	9729	While en route, Washington learned of Trent's retreat.
1991	9730	Since Tanaghrisson had promised support to the British, Washington continued toward Fort Duquesne and met with the Mingo leader.
1991	9731	Learning of a French scouting party in the area, Washington, with Tanaghrisson and his party, surprised the Canadians on May 28 in what became known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen.
1991	9732	They killed many of the Canadians, including their commanding officer, Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk.
1991	9733	The historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and regain authority over his own people.
1991	9734	They had been inclined to support the French, with whom they had long trading relationships.
1991	9735	One of Tanaghrisson's men told Contrecoeur that Jumonville had been killed by British musket fire.
1992	9736	News of the two battles reached England in August.
1992	9737	After several months of negotiations, the government of the Duke of Newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French.
1992	9738	They chose Major General Edward Braddock to lead the expedition.
1992	9739	Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock's departure for North America.
1992	9740	In response, King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France under the command of Baron Dieskau in 1755.
1992	9741	The British, intending to blockade French ports, sent out their fleet in February 1755, but the French fleet had already sailed.
1992	9742	Admiral Edward Hawke detached a fast squadron to North America in an attempt to intercept the French.
1993	9743	An early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the Albany Congress in June and July, 1754.
1993	9744	The goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians, since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the success in the war that was unfolding.
1993	9745	The plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown.
1993	9746	Nevertheless, the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence.
1994	9747	Braddock (with George Washington as one of his aides) led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in June 1755 to take Fort Duquesne.
1994	9748	It was attacked by French and Indian soldiers ambushing them from up in trees and behind logs.
1994	9749	Approximately 1,000 British soldiers were killed or injured.
1994	9750	The remaining 500 British troops, led by George Washington, retreated to Virginia.
1994	9751	Two future opponents in the American Revolutionary War, Washington and Thomas Gage, played key roles in organizing the retreat.
1995	9752	The French acquired a copy of the British war plans, including the activities of Shirley and Johnson.
1995	9753	Shirley's efforts to fortify Oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties, exacerbated by Shirley's inexperience in managing large expeditions.
1995	9754	In conjunction, Shirley was made aware that the French were massing for an attack on Fort Oswego in his absence when he planned to attack Fort Niagara.
1995	9755	As a response, Shirley left garrisons at Oswego, Fort Bull, and Fort Williams (the latter two located on the Oneida Carry between the Mohawk River and Wood Creek at present-day Rome, New York).
1995	9756	Supplies for use in the projected attack on Niagara were cached at Fort Bull.
1996	9757	Johnson's expedition was better organized than Shirley's, which was noticed by New France's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil.
1996	9758	He had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the Ohio, and had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses at Frontenac against Shirley's expected attack.
1996	9759	When Johnson was seen as the larger threat, Vaudreuil sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric to meet that threat.
1996	9760	Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River, but Johnson had strongly fortified it, and Dieskau's Indian support was reluctant to attack.
1996	9761	The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry.
1996	9762	The battle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field.
1996	9763	Johnson's advance stopped at Fort William Henry, and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point, where they began the construction of Fort Carillon (later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after British capture in 1759).
1997	9764	Colonel Monckton, in the sole British success that year, captured Fort Beauséjour in June 1755, cutting the French fortress at Louisbourg off from land-based reinforcements.
1997	9765	To cut vital supplies to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia's Governor Charles Lawrence ordered the deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area.
1997	9766	Monckton's forces, including companies of Rogers' Rangers, forcibly removed thousands of Acadians, chasing down many who resisted, and sometimes committing atrocities.
1997	9767	More than any other factor, the cutting off of supplies to Louisbourg led to its demise.
1997	9768	The Acadian resistance, in concert with native allies, including the Mi'kmaq, was sometimes quite stiff, with ongoing frontier raids (against Dartmouth and Lunenburg among others).
1997	9769	Other than the campaigns to expel the Acadians (ranging around the Bay of Fundy, on the Petitcodiac and St. John rivers, and Île Saint-Jean), the only clashes of any size were at Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757.
1998	9770	Following the death of Braddock, William Shirley assumed command of British forces in North America.
1998	9771	At a meeting in Albany in December 1755, he laid out his plans for 1756.
1998	9772	In addition to renewing the efforts to capture Niagara, Crown Point and Duquesne, he proposed attacks on Fort Frontenac on the north shore of Lake Ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the Maine district and down the Chaudière River to attack the city of Quebec.
1998	9773	Bogged down by disagreements and disputes with others, including William Johnson and New York's Governor Sir Charles Hardy, Shirley's plan had little support.
1999	9774	Newcastle replaced him in January 1756 with Lord Loudoun, with Major General James Abercrombie as his second in command.
1999	9775	Neither of these men had as much campaign experience as the trio of officers France sent to North America.
1999	9776	French regular army reinforcements arrived in New France in May 1756, led by Major General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and seconded by the Chevalier de Lévis and Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque, all experienced veterans from the War of the Austrian Succession.
1999	9777	During that time in Europe, on May 18, 1756, England formally declared war on France, which expanded the war into Europe, which was later to be known as the Seven Years' War.
2000	9778	Governor Vaudreuil, who harboured ambitions to become the French commander in chief (in addition to his role as governor), acted during the winter of 1756 before those reinforcements arrived.
2000	9779	Scouts had reported the weakness of the British supply chain, so he ordered an attack against the forts Shirley had erected at the Oneida Carry.
2000	9780	In the March Battle of Fort Bull, French forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies, including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder.
2000	9781	They set back any British hopes for campaigns on Lake Ontario, and endangered the Oswego garrison, already short on supplies.
2000	9782	French forces in the Ohio valley also continued to intrigue with Indians throughout the area, encouraging them to raid frontier settlements.
2000	9783	This led to ongoing alarms along the western frontiers, with streams of refugees returning east to get away from the action.
2001	9784	The new British command was not in place until July.
2001	9785	When he arrived in Albany, Abercrombie refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them.
2001	9786	Montcalm took bold action against his inertia.
2001	9787	Building on Vaudreuil's work harassing the Oswego garrison, Montcalm executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga, as if to presage another attack along Lake George.
2001	9788	With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany, Montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on Oswego in August.
2001	9789	In the aftermath, Montcalm and the Indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects.
2001	9790	The Europeans did not consider them prizes and prevented the Indians from stripping the prisoners of their valuables, which angered the Indians.
2002	9791	Loudoun, a capable administrator but a cautious field commander, planned one major operation for 1757: an attack on New France's capital, Quebec.
2002	9792	Leaving a sizable force at Fort William Henry to distract Montcalm, he began organizing for the expedition to Quebec.
2002	9793	He was then ordered by William Pitt, the Secretary of State responsible for the colonies, to attack Louisbourg first.
2002	9794	Beset by delays of all kinds, the expedition was finally ready to sail from Halifax, Nova Scotia in early August.
2002	9795	In the meantime French ships had escaped the British blockade of the French coast, and a fleet outnumbering the British one awaited Loudoun at Louisbourg.
2002	9796	Faced with this strength, Loudoun returned to New York amid news that a massacre had occurred at Fort William Henry.
2003	9797	French irregular forces (Canadian scouts and Indians) harassed Fort William Henry throughout the first half of 1757.
2003	9798	In January they ambushed British rangers near Ticonderoga.
2003	9799	In February they launched a daring raid against the position across the frozen Lake George, destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification.
2003	9800	In early August, Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort, which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole.
2003	9801	When the withdrawal began, some of Montcalm's Indian allies, angered at the lost opportunity for loot, attacked the British column, killing and capturing several hundred men, women, children, and slaves.
2003	9802	The aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of smallpox into remote Indian populations; as some Indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the Mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward having been exposed to European carriers.
2004	9803	Vaudreuil and Montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758, as the British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping.
2004	9804	The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot, the intendant of the territory.
2004	9805	His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates.
2004	9806	A massive outbreak of smallpox among western tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758.
2004	9807	While many parties to the conflict blamed others (the Indians blamed the French for bringing "bad medicine" as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry), the disease was probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle.
2004	9808	Montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg, while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years.
2005	9809	The British failures in North America, combined with other failures in the European theater, led to the fall from power of Newcastle and his principal military advisor, the Duke of Cumberland.
2005	9810	Newcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which Pitt dominated the military planning.
2005	9811	He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun.
2005	9812	He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757.
2005	9813	Pitt's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops, supported by the provincial militias, aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France.
2005	9814	Two of the expeditions were successful, with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg falling to sizable British forces.
2006	9815	The third invasion was stopped with the improbable French victory in the Battle of Carillon, in which 3,600 Frenchmen famously and decisively defeated Abercrombie's force of 18,000 regulars, militia and Native American allies outside the fort the French called Carillon and the British called Ticonderoga.
2006	9816	Abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent John Bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed Fort Frontenac, including caches of supplies destined for New France's western forts and furs destined for Europe.
2006	9817	Abercrombie was recalled and replaced by Jeffery Amherst, victor at Louisbourg.
2007	9818	In the aftermath of generally poor French results in most theaters of the Seven Years' War in 1758, France's new foreign minister, the duc de Choiseul, decided to focus on an invasion of Britain, to draw British resources away from North America and the European mainland.
2007	9819	The invasion failed both militarily and politically, as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France, and sent funds to Britain's ally on the mainland, Prussia, and the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay.
2007	9820	In one piece of good fortune, some French supply ships managed to depart France, eluding the British blockade of the French coast.
2008	9821	British victories continued in all theaters in the Annus Mirabilis of 1759, when they finally captured Ticonderoga, James Wolfe defeated Montcalm at Quebec (in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders), and victory at Fort Niagara successfully cut off the French frontier forts further to the west and south.
2008	9822	The victory was made complete in 1760 when, despite losing outside Quebec City in the Battle of Sainte-Foy, the British were able to prevent the arrival of French relief ships in the naval Battle of the Restigouche while armies marched on Montreal from three sides.
2009	9823	In September 1760, and before any hostilities erupted, Governor Vaudreuil negotiated from Montreal a capitulation with General Amherst.
2009	9824	Amherst granted Vaudreuil's request that any French residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition, continued ownership of their property, and the right to remain undisturbed in their homes.
2009	9825	The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers and French regular troops were returned to France aboard British ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war.
2010	9826	The war in North America officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763, and war in the European theatre of the Seven Years' War was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763.
2010	9827	The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which had been occupied by the British.
2010	9828	France chose to cede the former, but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, along with fishing rights in the area.
2010	9829	They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent.
2010	9830	The contemporaneous French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow.
2010	9831	The British, for their part, were happy to take New France, as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue and also because they already had ample places from which to obtain sugar.
2010	9832	Spain, which traded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba, also gained Louisiana, including New Orleans, from France in compensation for its losses.
2010	9833	Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations.
2011	9834	Britain gained control of French Canada and Acadia, colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French-speaking Roman Catholic residents.
2011	9835	The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 resulted in land made available to migrants from Europe and the colonies further south.
2011	9836	The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces, but many went to France, and some went to New Orleans, which they had expected to remain French.
2011	9837	Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands; these latter efforts were unsuccessful.
2011	9838	Others migrated to places like Saint-Domingue, and fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution.
2011	9839	The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population.
2011	9840	(The French word "Acadien" evolved to "Cadien", then to "Cajun".)
2012	9841	Following the treaty, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7, 1763, which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations.
2012	9842	Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population, a demarcation that was at best a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers.
2012	9843	The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians.
2012	9844	When accommodations were made in the Quebec Act in 1774 to address this and other issues, religious concerns were raised in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of "popery"; the Act maintained French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code soon to be removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution.
2013	9845	For many native populations, the elimination of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion, leading to their ultimate dispossession.
2013	9846	The Ohio Country was particularly vulnerable to legal and illegal settlement due to the construction of military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes.
2013	9847	Although the Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory (which was not completed until 1769) had modest repercussions, the British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the British, and a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek, historic enemies whose divisions the British at times exploited.
2013	9848	The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave.
2013	9849	Most went to Cuba, including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine, although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico.
2014	9850	Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force.
2014	9851	In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion.
2014	9852	A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity.
2014	9853	Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton.
2014	9854	With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years.
2014	9855	By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.
2015	9856	With modern insights into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light, particle physics has devised a Standard Model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms.
2015	9857	The Standard Model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed.
2015	9858	Only four main interactions are known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.
2015	9859	:2–10:79 High-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction.
2016	9860	Aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of Aristotelian cosmology.
2016	9861	In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different "natural places" therein.
2016	9862	Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone.
2016	9863	He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their "natural place" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to "natural motion", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force.
2016	9864	This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows.
2016	9865	The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it.
2016	9866	Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target.
2016	9867	This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.
2017	9868	The shortcomings of Aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of Galileo Galilei, who was influenced by the late Medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus.
2017	9869	Galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the Aristotelian theory of motion early in the 17th century.
2017	9870	He showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force, for example friction.
2018	9871	Newton's First Law of Motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force or resultant force.
2018	9872	This law is an extension of Galileo's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force (see a more detailed description of this below).
2018	9873	Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium "natural state" in place of the Aristotelian idea of the "natural state of rest".
2018	9874	That is, the first law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity.
2018	9875	By making rest physically indistinguishable from non-zero constant velocity, Newton's First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities.
2018	9876	Specifically, in systems where objects are moving with different velocities, it is impossible to determine which object is "in motion" and which object is "at rest".
2018	9877	In other words, to phrase matters more technically, the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference, that is, in all frames related by a Galilean transformation.
2019	9878	For instance, while traveling in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity, the laws of physics do not change from being at rest.
2019	9879	A person can throw a ball straight up in the air and catch it as it falls down without worrying about applying a force in the direction the vehicle is moving.
2019	9880	This is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle.
2019	9881	It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down.
2019	9882	From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction.
2019	9883	Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable.
2019	9884	Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.
2020	9885	The concept of inertia can be further generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion, even those that are not strictly constant velocity.
2020	9886	The rotational inertia of planet Earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year.
2020	9887	Albert Einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration, such as those free-falling toward a gravitating object, were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames.
2020	9888	This is why, for example, astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the Earth, and why Newton's Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments.
2020	9889	If an astronaut places an object with mass in mid-air next to himself, it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia.
2020	9890	This is the same thing that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space with no net force of gravity acting on their shared reference frame.
2020	9891	This principle of equivalence was one of the foundational underpinnings for the development of the general theory of relativity.
2021	9892	Newton's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass.
2021	9893	Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements.
2021	9894	However, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass.
2021	9895	General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales.
2021	9896	With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.
2022	9897	Newton's Third Law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects.
2022	9898	The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies,[Note 3] and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body.
2022	9899	Whenever a first body exerts a force F on a second body, the second body exerts a force −F on the first body.
2022	9900	F and −F are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
2022	9901	This law is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law, with F called the "action" and −F the "reaction".
2022	9902	The action and the reaction are simultaneous:
2023	9903	This means that in a closed system of particles, there are no internal forces that are unbalanced.
2023	9904	That is, the action-reaction force shared between any two objects in a closed system will not cause the center of mass of the system to accelerate.
2023	9905	The constituent objects only accelerate with respect to each other, the system itself remains unaccelerated.
2023	9906	Alternatively, if an external force acts on the system, then the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.
2024	9907	Since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces.
2024	9908	As with other physical concepts (e.g.
2024	9909	temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions that are consistent with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale.
2024	9910	Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.
2025	9911	Forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is.
2025	9912	Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as "vector quantities".
2025	9913	This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities).
2025	9914	For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result.
2025	9915	If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous.
2025	9916	For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be.
2025	9917	The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction.
2025	9918	In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other.
2025	9919	Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.
2026	9920	Historically, forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out.
2026	9921	Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction.
2026	9922	When two forces act on a point particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram.
2026	9923	The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action.
2026	9924	However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body.
2027	9925	As well as being added, forces can also be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other.
2027	9926	A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east.
2027	9927	Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force.
2027	9928	Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions.
2027	9929	This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors.
2027	9930	Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other.
2027	9931	Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient.
2027	9932	Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component.
2027	9933	Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.
2028	9934	Pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface.
2028	9935	For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration.
2028	9936	The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.
2029	9937	A static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces, using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances.
2029	9938	For example, an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the "spring reaction force", which equals the object's weight.
2029	9939	Using such tools, some quantitative force laws were discovered: that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density (widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights); Archimedes' principle for buoyancy; Archimedes' analysis of the lever; Boyle's law for gas pressure; and Hooke's law for springs.
2029	9940	These were all formulated and experimentally verified before Isaac Newton expounded his Three Laws of Motion.
2030	9941	Dynamic equilibrium was first described by Galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic.
2030	9942	Galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an "absolute rest frame" did not exist.
2030	9943	Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest.
2030	9944	This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a "natural state" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached.
2030	9945	Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct.
2030	9946	For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it.
2030	9947	Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship.
2030	9948	However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it.
2030	9949	Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls.
2030	9950	Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity.
2031	9951	A simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction.
2031	9952	In such a situation, a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force.
2031	9953	This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity.
2031	9954	Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force.
2031	9955	However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.
2032	9956	The notion "force" keeps its meaning in quantum mechanics, though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the Schrödinger equation instead of Newtonian equations.
2032	9957	This has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes "quantized", i.e.
2032	9958	This is, of course, difficult to imagine in the context of "forces".
2032	9959	However, the potentials V(x,y,z) or fields, from which the forces generally can be derived, are treated similar to classical position variables, i.e., .
2033	9960	However, already in quantum mechanics there is one "caveat", namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable, but also a discrete intrinsic angular momentum-like variable called the "spin", and there is the Pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables.
2033	9961	Depending on the value of the spin, identical particles split into two different classes, fermions and bosons.
2033	9962	electrons) have a symmetric spin function (e.g.
2033	9963	parallel spins) the spatial variables must be antisymmetric (i.e.
2033	9964	they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force), and vice versa, i.e.
2033	9965	for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric (i.e.
2033	9966	the apparent force must be attractive).
2033	9967	Thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables, whereas for two bosons (e.g.
2033	9968	quanta of electromagnetic waves, photons) the correlation is strictly positive.
2034	9969	In modern particle physics, forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying gauge bosons.
2034	9970	With the development of quantum field theory and general relativity, it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum (4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics).
2034	9971	The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force.
2034	9972	Thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be "fundamental interactions".
2034	9973	:199–128 When particle A emits (creates) or absorbs (annihilates) virtual particle B, a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A' exchanging by B.
2034	9974	This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions.
2034	9975	While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the accurate result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams.
2034	9976	In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see world line) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram.
2034	9977	Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram.
2034	9978	World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines.
2034	9979	Gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and, in the case of virtual particle exchange, are absorbed at an adjacent vertex.
2035	9980	All of the forces in the universe are based on four fundamental interactions.
2035	9981	The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and are responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei.
2035	9982	The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses.
2035	9983	All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions.
2035	9984	For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other.
2035	9985	Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position.
2035	9986	Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.
2036	9987	The development of fundamental theories for forces proceeded along the lines of unification of disparate ideas.
2036	9988	For example, Isaac Newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation.
2036	9989	Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism.
2036	9990	In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons.
2036	9991	This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation.
2036	9992	The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete.
2036	9993	A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics.
2036	9994	Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything.
2036	9995	Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.
2037	9996	What we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work of Isaac Newton.
2037	9997	Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects.
2037	9998	Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object.
2037	9999	Today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as  and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth.
2037	10000	This observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the Earth's surface is directly proportional to the object's mass.
2037	10001	Thus an object that has a mass of  will experience a force:
2038	10002	Newton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances.
2038	10003	In particular, Newton determined that the acceleration of the Moon around the Earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law.
2038	10004	Further, Newton realized that the acceleration due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the attracting body.
2038	10005	Combining these ideas gives a formula that relates the mass () and the radius () of the Earth to the gravitational acceleration:
2039	10006	In this equation, a dimensional constant  is used to describe the relative strength of gravity.
2039	10007	This constant has come to be known as Newton's Universal Gravitation Constant, though its value was unknown in Newton's lifetime.
2039	10008	Not until 1798 was Henry Cavendish able to make the first measurement of  using a torsion balance; this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the Earth since knowing  could allow one to solve for the Earth's mass given the above equation.
2039	10009	Newton, however, realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same laws of motion, his law of gravity had to be universal.
2039	10010	Succinctly stated, Newton's Law of Gravitation states that the force on a spherical object of mass  due to the gravitational pull of mass  is
2040	10011	It was only the orbit of the planet Mercury that Newton's Law of Gravitation seemed not to fully explain.
2040	10012	Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet (Vulcan) that would explain the discrepancies; however, despite some early indications, no such planet could be found.
2040	10013	When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (GR) he turned his attention to the problem of Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which could account for the discrepancy.
2040	10014	This was the first time that Newton's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be less correct than an alternative.
2041	10015	Since then, and so far, general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity.
2041	10016	In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time – defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events.
2041	10017	From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever.
2041	10018	It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path.
2041	10019	Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object.
2041	10020	For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field.
2041	10021	Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years).
2041	10022	The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as "gravitational force".
2042	10023	Through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge, a rule of vector multiplication called Lorentz's Law describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field.
2042	10024	The connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified electromagnetic force that acts on a charge.
2042	10025	This force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force (due to the electric field) and the magnetic force (due to the magnetic field).
2042	10026	Fully stated, this is the law:
2043	10027	The origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when James Clerk Maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations, which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by Oliver Heaviside and Josiah Willard Gibbs.
2043	10028	These "Maxwell Equations" fully described the sources of the fields as being stationary and moving charges, and the interactions of the fields themselves.
2043	10029	This led Maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be "self-generating" through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light.
2043	10030	This insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with optics and led directly to a complete description of the electromagnetic spectrum.
2044	10031	However, attempting to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations, the photoelectric effect, and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe, proved troublesome.
2044	10032	Through the work of leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics.
2044	10033	This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons.
2044	10034	In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.
2045	10035	It is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter to the repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force.
2045	10036	However, these characteristics actually result from the Pauli exclusion principle.
2045	10037	[citation needed] Since electrons are fermions, they cannot occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons.
2045	10038	When the electrons in a material are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states.
2045	10039	This means that it takes energy to pack them together.
2045	10040	While this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force, it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states.
2046	10041	The strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles.
2046	10042	However, a residual of the force is observed between hadrons (the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei) as the nuclear force.
2046	10043	Here the strong force acts indirectly, transmitted as gluons, which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons, which classically transmit the nuclear force (see this topic for more).
2046	10044	The failure of many searches for free quarks has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable.
2046	10045	This phenomenon is called color confinement.
2047	10046	The weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy W and Z bosons.
2047	10047	Its most familiar effect is beta decay (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated radioactivity.
2047	10048	The word "weak" derives from the fact that the field strength is some 1013 times less than that of the strong force.
2047	10049	Still, it is stronger than gravity over short distances.
2047	10050	A consistent electroweak theory has also been developed, which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins.
2047	10051	Such temperatures have been probed in modern particle accelerators and show the conditions of the universe in the early moments of the Big Bang.
2048	10052	The normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact.
2048	10053	When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects.
2048	10054	:93 The normal force, for example, is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object.
2048	10055	An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.
2049	10056	Tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable.
2049	10057	They can be combined with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction.
2049	10058	Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object.
2049	10059	By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied.
2049	10060	For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load.
2049	10061	However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load.
2049	10062	These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.
2050	10063	Newton's laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects.
2050	10064	However, in real life, matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object.
2050	10065	For situations where lattice holding together the atoms in an object is able to flow, contract, expand, or otherwise change shape, the theories of continuum mechanics describe the way forces affect the material.
2050	10066	For example, in extended fluids, differences in pressure result in forces being directed along the pressure gradients as follows:
2051	10067	where  is the relevant cross-sectional area for the volume for which the stress-tensor is being calculated.
2051	10068	This formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area (the matrix diagonals of the tensor) as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area (the off-diagonal elements).
2051	10069	The stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains (deformations) including also tensile stresses and compressions.
2052	10070	Torque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that angle is the rotational equivalent for position, angular velocity for velocity, and angular momentum for momentum.
2052	10071	As a consequence of Newton's First Law of Motion, there exists rotational inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque.
2052	10072	Likewise, Newton's Second Law of Motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous angular acceleration of the rigid body:
2053	10073	where  is the mass of the object,  is the velocity of the object and  is the distance to the center of the circular path and  is the unit vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center.
2053	10074	This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path.
2053	10075	Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector.
2053	10076	The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path.
2053	10077	This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.
2054	10078	A conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms.
2054	10079	This means that for a closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system.
2054	10080	The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.
2055	10081	For certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials.
2055	10082	This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates.
2055	10083	For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector.
2055	10084	Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag.
2055	10085	However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.
2056	10086	The connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics.
2056	10087	In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat.
2056	10088	According to the Second law of thermodynamics, nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases.
2057	10089	The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less commonly used than the newton: the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass.
2057	10090	The kilogram-force leads to an alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at 1 m·s−2 when subjected to a force of 1 kgf.
2057	10091	The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque.
2057	10092	Other arcane units of force include the sthène, which is equivalent to 1000 N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000 lbf.
